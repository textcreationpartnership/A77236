            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which is therefore called <hi>Will-Worſhip. Col.</hi> 2.21, 23.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever it be <hi>Religion,</hi> out of the fear and love of God, to keep his Commandements as well of the Second as Firſt Table, yet the conſcionable obſerving of the Commandments contained in the firſt Table is, by an excellency, called <hi>Religion;</hi> And whereas man cannot judge of ſuch obſerving the firſt and third Commandments, therefore is he eſteemed <hi>Religions,</hi> who maketh conſcience of the ſecond and fourth Commandements; In ſanctifying the Sabbath with ſuch an outward manner of Worſhip, as is not after mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but according to Gods Word.</p>
                     <p>So that by <hi>Religion,</hi> in this poſition is meant the outward (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally publique) worſhip of God: <hi>Religion</hi> being put for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fear of God to ſerve him preciſely according to his Word, is, of all the actions of men, eſpecially to be manifeſt in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, who will be ſanctified in all them that come near him, if they offer ſtrange fire, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Religion</hi> (then) being put for <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip,</hi> the Poſition is granted. For indeed the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:119992:3"/> of God, doth conſiſt only of Ceremonies, that is, outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of inward Worſhip. But, how doth this follow, The outward Worſhip of God cannot ſtand without ſome Ceremonies, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It cannot ſtand without the Ceremonies in queſtion. As though <hi>Religion</hi> had no better ground than <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops</hi> have, according to this Maxim: <hi>No Ceremony, no Biſhop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But more clearly to perceive the truth, it is to be conſidered, that ſome Ceremonies by nature, or general cuſtome demonſtrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, as not only ſigns thereof, but effects alſo. Other do the ſame, as ſigns only by Inſtitution. By which inſtituted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; God is not worſhipped except they be by himſelf preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; For as no fire could make any Sacrifice a ſavour of reſt to God, but that which came from God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.24. and 10.1, 2. So no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant can make outward worſhip, or any part thereof acceptable to God, but that which cometh from God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it doth not follow, that becauſe <hi>kneeling</hi> in Prayer is lawful, therefore the Ceremonies in queſtion (namely the <hi>Surplice</hi>) be ſo too. For 1. Nature teacheth us to manifeſt inward reverence by outward geſtures. 2. General cuſtom amongſt us maketh <hi>kneeling</hi> the moſt ſolemn ſign of the greateſt reverence. 3. In true Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God <hi>kneeling</hi> is not only a ſign of inward Worſhip, but an effect alſo. 4. It is warranted by the Word. And 5. It is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the outward Worſhip of God: For men do uſually, and may lawfully, demonſtrate their inward reverencing of men by kneeling. Whereas the Ceremonies in queſtion (namely che Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice) do not demonſtrate inward Worſhip by Nature: For then all religious Worſhippers would (at leaſt) have a diſpoſition to uſe the Surplice at all times, and in all places. (2.) None can affirm, that general cuſtome maketh a Surplice a ſign of inward Worſhip. Becauſe the publike uſe of it is moſtwhat omitted or enforced, and there is no ſuch matter as the private uſe thereof, and by private perſons. In both which conſiderations it may be (3) denied to be an effect of inward Worſhip, and the rather if it cannot be proved to be as effect of the obedience of faith to ſome commandment of God, preſcribing the ſame. Which (4.) cannot be; Seeing in all the New Teſtament there is neither Precept, nor Example, nor other matter of neceſſary concluſion warranting the ſame. And yet (5.) It is appropriated to the Service of God, and therefore ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and not religious, eſpecially being urged as it is.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ivine Worſhip is any action or ſervice that is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly and directly performed unto God himſelf, whether the true God or a falſe, whether comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Divine Authority, impoſed by humane, or aſſumed upon our own heads and pleaſures. For in this latitude of ſenſe is Divine Worſhip to be conceived, that it may comprehend under it both true and falſe Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though all Actions and Services that Man performeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man are not parts of Civil Worſhip, yet every Action and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that Man performeth directly to God, is a part of Divine Worſhip, and ought meerly to concern his own glory. It being impoſſible to imagine how the Creature ſhould perform any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or do any action to the Creator himſelf but Worſhip. For the ground of Worſhip is the ſence of ſome excellent eminency of goodneſs in the Party worſhipped, and defect and inability to do an anſwerable good to a good received in the party worſhipping,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119992:6"/> for we need not to worſhip God if we could be as good to him as he is to us, and therefore (except we ſhould mock him) becauſe receiving all good from him, we are not able to do the leaſt good unto him; all that we can do, is to worſhip him, that is, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him above all things; and debaſe our ſelves before him as nothing in his preſence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All ſpecial things therefore done in the Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is Worſhip: and a part of that honour that is done unto him. And whatſoever ſpecial thing done in Divine Service, is not a ſpecial honour and worſhip unto God, muſt needs be a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and abuſe of his Majeſty, who requireth nothing but worſhip at our hands, and unto whom we cannot poſſibly do any other good.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If therefore a man ſhall do any ſpecial Action in the Service of God, of which there is no uſe out of the ſame: and that Action ſo done, bring no ſpecial honour to God; the doing of it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Name of God. For all ſpecial Actions done in the Service of God, muſt either bring ſpecial honour to God, or elſe they muſt needs diſhonour him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Divine Worſhip is Internal only or External alſo. Internal worſhip is meerly ſpiritual, and performed only within the temple of mans heart, of which none are witneſſes but God and a mans own conſcience. All the inward motions of the heart directed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God are parts of this VVorſhip, as Faith, Hope, Confidence, Love, Fear and Joy in God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all of them divers acts and parts of Inward worſhip, in every one of which God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. All which ſpring from the apprehenſion of our own wants, and Gods infinite excellency and goodneſs towards us. We need not proceed any further in handling of this Worſhip, it nothing appertaineth to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. External Worſhip is an expreſſing and ſetting forth of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal by outward ſigns and rites: By which, as by certain outward bodily ſhadows and colours, the ſpiritual and Inward Worſhip of God is made viſible and ſenſible to others.</p>

                     <p>THeſe ſigns and rites are called Ceremonies. A Ceremony is a corporeal adumbration of ſome hidden thing in the mind, that it deſireth to affect others withall, in ſome effectual manner, for by ſuch means as theſe, are the ſecrets of the ſoul diſcloſed and painted out or figured to our own and others bodily ſenſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such actions properly are ceremonial, that are meer ſhadows and ſigns, exhibiting nothing but ſome ſimilitude and reſemblance of ſuch things as man is deſirous, but not able to exhibite in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and in deed. And therefore are called complements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in doing them a man laboureth to ſupply that in a ſhadow, that he cannot do in ſubſtance. And hence it is that the more unable a man is to do that he would, the more he uſeth to ſupply his defect with ſigns and tokens.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Natural Ceremonies.</head>
                     <p>CEremonies are either Natural or Inſtituted. Natural Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are all ſuch voluntary compoſitions and geſtures of the body, as are with moderate deliberation uſed to ſhadow-forth thoſe hidden motions, affections, and habits of the mind, that are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the mind by ſome goodneſs in thoſe unto whom they are performed and done; for a man performeth no ceremony unto himſelf, but unto others, and the ground of that ceremony is in him unto whom it is performed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For example: Authority in another, begetteth reverence in me. This reverence poſſeſſing and affecting my ſoul, it breedeth in me a deſire to manifeſt it unto the party reverenced; but I cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do it by any other means, but by ſome bodily ſhadow and ſign, whereupon nature teacheth me to bow the body; the like may be ſaid of lifting up of hands, caſting up the eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All of which kind are certain natural impreſſions of the ſoul, made in and upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119992:7"/> the body, endeavouring in and by them to make her hidden motions ſo viſible and effectual, as they may affect our ſelves and others.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Comlineſs and decency doth eſpecially conſiſt in the uſe of Ceremonies of this kind, and they have been ever carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church of God, as well before Chriſt as ſince, both in her publike and private miniſtrations; which wilfully to neglect, were to ſin againſt God, and for any to inhibite only upon their will and pleaſure, were impiety. But theſe Ceremonies in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie are of another nature as ſhall afterward appear.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This firſt kind of Ceremonies, the more natural they are, and the more they ſhall appear to flow from the free and inforced will of him that acteth them, the more decent and of greater grace they are, for they are ſuch ſhadows as are ſent forth from our paſſions by the light of nature, and are not fit for any other uſe or ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And as nature only frameth them well, ſo if it ſhall appear that they proceed from her, and are not forced and wrung from men <hi>(invita minerva)</hi> ſhe putteth into them ſuch a light, that any of ordinary conceit may in the ſign ſee the thing ſignified.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Theſe Ceremonies though Natural, and therefore common to all men, yet are they not in all degrees univerſally the ſame, becauſe having their original from the natural motions and conceptions of the mind, eſpecially paſſion and affection, by which they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and formed, there being in the ſtock of mankind ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of natures and diſpoſitions; ſuch divers degrees of the ſame inclination; ſuch a divers compoſition and mingling of affections, it cannot be but nature muſt needs vary and be divers in them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And though they are natural, yet are they no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſuch as nature by violence forceth and wringeth from men (as the actions of panting and breathing) ſuch as men cannot at their pleaſure abſtain from, or lay down; for laughter in extreme mirth, and weeping in great ſorrow, though they be natural impreſſions and ſigns of inward and hidden paſſions, yet are they not Ceremonies; but ſuch <hi>ſignes</hi> only are Ceremonies, wherein there is concurrence both of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> in the framing and uſe of them, as appeareth in the particulars above ſpecified; and therefore are ſuch as may upon ſome ſpecial or particular occaſions, be omitted or ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thus much of <hi>natural</hi> Ceremonies. Inſtituted Ceremonies are ſuch outward <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ſigns</hi> as by reaſon of ſome Analogy or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119992:7"/> ſimilitude, are ordained and appointed to ſignifie and ſhadow forth any <hi>mystical truth,</hi> they being not brought forth by nature to any ſuch end or purpoſe. Of which kind are all the Jewiſh Ceremonies, Our Sacraments, All Paganiſh and Popiſh Rites, and thoſe Ceremonies in preſent controverſie. For none of all thoſe externall Rites, do by nature ſignifie any ſuch matter, but their uſes and ſignifications are put upon them only by the will of the <hi>institutor</hi> or uſer, and are not ſo much intended for decency and order, as for <hi>ſolemnitie</hi> and <hi>ſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Thoſe things that are put to this Ceremonial uſe, being not made by nature to any ſuch end or purpoſe, muſt, if they be not vain and fooliſh, borrow light from ſome <hi>word</hi> of <hi>inſtitution,</hi> for the more <hi>myſtical</hi> the Ceremonies of this kind are, and of ſecreter ſenſe, of greater grace they are.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Natural Ceremonies, if by inſtitution and appointment they be put to any other uſe than nature it ſelf hath fitted them unto; do loſe their name, and become inſtituted Ceremonies, as <hi>kneeling</hi> tied to eating and drinking in the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Civil and <hi>Religious</hi> Ceremonies in general.</head>
                     <p>THE Uſe of both theſe kindes of Ceremonies, that is, natural and inſtituted, is either in civil ſervice; of man to man, or in religious ſervices of man to God, from whence Ceremonies receive a ſecond Denomination, and are called (whether they be natural or inſtituted) either Civill or Religious Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Civil Ceremonies therefore are ſuch <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as are performed in Civill Offices and Duties between man and man, as they are members of a Civill Body, or Incorporation: The right uſe whereof is called Civility, and the contempt <hi>rudeneſs;</hi> the end of Civil Ceremonies is to ſignifie and ſhadow thoſe inward affections that one man deſireth to ſhew to another: In the due uſe of theſe Ceremonies conſiſts <hi>humanity, lowlineſs, courteſie, good manners, civil ſtate, and pompe,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe the Ceremonies of this kinde are not controverted, we paſſe them by.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Religious Ceremonies are ſuch outward Rites as are performed in religious Duties and ſervices of man to God: and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119992:8"/> they are outward ſhadowes of <hi>zeal, devotion, faith, holineſs, reveren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> of the Majeſty of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the uſe of theſe Ceremonies eſpecially doth external worſhip conſiſt, whether true or falſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Religious Ceremonies are either <hi>common</hi> or <hi>proper:</hi> Common Ceremonies are ſuch as are equally uſed in civil and religious matters: bowing the knee uſed in prayer, is a religious Ceremony, ſignifying in that action a Divine Reverence of God. Yet it is not a Ceremony peculiar and proper to Religion, becauſe it is a Ceremony that is and may be uſed to the Magiſtrate, to ſhadow forth alſo civill Worſhip due unto him. Of which nature all natural Ceremonies ſeem to be, and any inſtituted Ceremony may be, if it have no reference to Religion in the Uſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Though matters of Civill Order and Decency be very improperly called Ceremonies, they being rather matters of ſubſtance, and it being impiety wilfully and without neceſſity to neglect them in the Congregation of <hi>Saints,</hi> or to do any thing contrary unto them: Yet all things tending thereto, may for Doctrine ſake be referred to this head. For though Gods worſhip do not conſiſt in them, yet Gods worſhip is prophaned in the wilfull contempt and neglect of them. Yea as far forth as naturall and civill decency and comlineſſe are outward ſhadowes of inward worſhip, They may be ſafely reputed parts of divine worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Matters therefore of Order and decency in the ſervice of God are all ſuch matters as are drawn from the ordinary civil Cuſtomes of men, and which for any to neglect wilfully, would ſeem to the reaſon of a naturall man a diſorderly and unſeemly thing. As to come to the Aſſembly clothed, and that in ſeemly and uſuall apparell, according to our civill Callings in the world, to ſit there quietly, and in a comely manner, in reſpect of compoſition of body, to give as much as may be, upper place to our civill Superiours; that the place of meeting be fair ſwept; that the Table of the Lord in the time of Communion, be ſpread after the civil faſhion of the Country, with a fair table-cloth; that men pray bare-headed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Orders uſed in civill Meetings of men, wherein civill decency is obſerved and kept, ought not to be neglected in religious Meetings, and therefore they may be called common Ceremonies or Orders.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Theſe Ceremonies of civil Order and decency, are of that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119992:8"/> nature and neceſſity, that for the Magiſtrate wilfully to inhibite, were ſin in him, and for any particular man not to uſe and obſerve as much as conveniently he can, (though Authority had never enjoyned them in particular) were impiety. And therefore they are of a far different nature from the Ceremonies in controverſie: For let it be ſuppoſed to be no ſin to uſe theſe when the Magiſtrate enjoyneth them: yea ſuppoſe them to be holy Ornaments and Rites, yet if no Authority humane or divine had inſtituted them, it had been no ſin for any man to neglect them, nay it were a foul ſin to uſe them. For example: Our Lords ſpiritual enjoyn every Miniſter in Divine Service, to wear a white linen Ephod or Surplice, they may (if it pleaſe them) as lawfully enjoyn him to have painted before and behinde two fair red croſſes: but if a private man upon his own head ſhould uſe his Surplice ſo, though it be an honourable ſigne that he addeth, it would be made a grievous crime.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They therefore do but gull the ſimple of the world, that from humane authority to inſtitute ſuch civil Orders as are above ſpecified, do inferre that man hath authority to bring into the ſervice and worſhip of God ſuch Ceremonies, as are clean of another nature. As though becauſe the Magiſtrate may ordain ſuch Ceremonies, as without his ordinance, were impiety for a man not to obſerve, therefore he may ordain ſuch Ceremonies which without his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance at leaſt, were impietie and wickedneſs for any to uſe.</p>

                     <p>THoſe Ceremonies that are proper to Religion are ſuch as in a peculiar manner are tied to religious perſons actions and purpoſes only, eſpecially ſuch as are in a ſpecial manner tied to the ſolemn worſhip of God.

                     <p n="3">3. As there are diverſities of Religion and Churches, ſo there are diverſities of Rites and Ceremonies by which they are diſtinguiſhed, and Ceremonies are the partition walls whereby (fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For he that ſhall with a more narrow eye ſeek into theſe things ſhall ſee, that for the moſt part, the diverſities and varieties of Ceremonies are the begetters of diverſity of Doctrines, and Opinions, whereby one Religion differeth from another.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The more one Church differeth from another in Rites and Ceremonies, the more it uſeth to differ in ſubſtance of Doctrine; and the more one Church draweth nearer unto another in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the more it draweth near unto it in ſubſtance of Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> in ſubſtance of Doctrine do ſo much the more differ from the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> by how much the farther they differ from her in Ceremonies, than other Churches; and ſome in the Church of <hi>England</hi> that do ſtrive to come to <hi>Rome</hi> in Ceremonies, come ſo much the nearer to her in Doctrine, as might appear by divers inſtances, if the matter were not too too apparent.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He that hates the Religion it ſelf, hates all the ſhadowes and ſhews of the Religion; and he that loves the ſhadows and Rites of a Religion, he loves the Religion it ſelf; he loves a Pope well that loves the triple Crown; he loves a Fryer well, that dotes upon his Cowl, and ſhaven crown; and out of queſtion he loves a Maſſeprieſt with all his heart, that is mad upon his maſſing attire, or any part thereof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As it is rudeneſs and want of civility, to neglect or contemn a Civil Ceremony, ſo it is prophaneſſe and irreligion to neglect or contemn a religious ceremony: and as outward civility conſiſts in the due uſe of civil Ceremonies, ſo outward holineſs and religion conſiſts in the due uſe of all Religious Ceremonies: Thoſe Ceremonies therefore are prophane and not beſeeming the true worſhip of God, that are ſo far from any ſhew of holineſſe in the uſe of them, that they make the partie that refuſeth the uſe of them to ſeem, and to be reputed pure, holy, and preciſe; of which nature our Ceremonies in controverſie are.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. As Civil Ceremonies tend to the honor of them unto whom
<pb facs="tcp:119992:9"/> civil worſhip is due, and is a part thereof: So Religious Ceremonies tend to the honor of him unto whom religious worſhip is due, and is a part thereof: neither can a man poſſibly imagine how any thing ſhould be religious, whether a ſubſtance or a Ceremony, but it muſt needs reſpect him that Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s therefore we performe civil honour unto thoſe unto whom we performe civil Ceremonies, ſo we performe Religious and Divine honours unto thoſe that we obey in a Religious Ceremonie. They therefore that claim and performe obedience therein, do claim and performe that which is due only to God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Nothing intended or done by man is an honour to God, but that which is an obedience unto God in ſome Commandement. All Ceremonies therefore of Religion that are an honour unto God, muſt be commanded by God himſelf: and to bring in ſuch Ceremonies into his worſhip as are no honour to him, is to mock God.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. All Religious Ceremonies or Ceremonies of Religion, are ſpiritual, that is, are ordained for ſpiritual uſes and ends, and not for civil or temporal, and therefore are outward notes and teſtimonies of thoſe things that make us ſpiritual men, and they are parts of ſpiritual honour due unto ſpiritual authority and Lordſhip.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All ſpiritual Lords may claim as their due, ſpiritual worſhip, and therefore may inſtitute religious Ceremonies: for look what difference there is between humane and divine, Temporal and Spiritual, the ſame difference there is between the peculiar worſhip due to the one, and to the other: if therefore Temporal Lords may require all civil rites and honors, Spiritual Lords may require all Divine and Spiritual Rites and honors.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Civil honor and reverence only, cannot nor ought not to pleaſe a <hi>Spiritual Lord,</hi> hence it is that the <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> of our Church cannot content themſelves with ſuch honor that we give to civil Magiſtrates and Princes, but we muſt obey them in peculiar religious duties and ſervices; and ſurely it is meet that if there be any ſuch beſides Chriſt, that we performe ſpiritual homage unto them, and they are not worthy that high ſtyle that will be content with temporalls, when ſpiritualls are due.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Thoſe Ceremonies that are enjoined by true ſpiritual Lords, are truly ſpiritual and holy, even as ſpiritual and holy as the Sacraments, though they conſiſt of ſome things in their own nature indifferent; and thoſe Lords are not ſpiritual, that are not able
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119992:10"/> by their ſole authority and word, to hallow that which before was not holy.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Thoſe that can make a Surplice, a Cope, a Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ornaments of Religion and holy Ceremonies: can, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, make a ſhaven Crown, a Monks habit, ſpittle in Baptiſm, holy Water, the triple Crown, and all the Miſſal Rites as holy. For they are all of the ſame nature: And thoſe that can find no reaſon to prove thoſe unholy and unlawful, would find none to prove any other external Rite to be ſo, if they ſhould in the ſame manner be impoſed.</p>
                     <p n="14">14.

                     <p>THus much of Divine Worſhip in general, both Inward and Outward, and of Ceremonies, wherein Outward Worſhip eſpecially conſiſteth. Now let us in ſpecial conſider the ſame. Divine Worſhip therefore is either true Worſhip or falſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. True Worſhip is that immediate ſervice that the true God himſelf requireth to be performed unto himſelf. In the exerciſe whereof conſiſteth true holineſs and Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. True Worſhip both for matter and manner, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript rule of Gods Word only: Neither hath any mortal man authority to frame according to his own conceit, any form or faſhion of Gods Service and Worſhip; for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhip alſo muſt be holy, and not the matter only; and no man hath power to make any thing holy, that God halloweth not by his Word and Spirit.</p>

                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:119992:10"/>4. All civil furtherances and neceſſary circumſtances of Gods ſolemn Worſhip, though they be not eſſentiall parts of the ſame, nor by ſpecial Nomination commanded: Yet are they to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Ordinances of God, and not humane inventions. As God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordained that this Saints dwelling together, both Men, Women and Children, of all ſorts and degrees, ſhould ordinarily at ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times meet together, it muſt needs be preſuppoſed to be his Ordinance that they meet together in ſome ſuch ordinary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are fitteſt for to receive moſt commodiouſly ſuch Aſſemblies: So God having ordained that his Miniſters ſhould preach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim ſalvation to a multitude gathered together, and that they ſhould ſit at his feet, hath alſo ordained that the Miniſters ſeat ſhould be higher than the reſt of the Peoples; and the like may be ſaid of all other ſuch Circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, which are matters of ſo baſe and low conſideration, and ſo ſubject to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, that it neither beſeemeth the majeſty of the Word of God in ſpecial, or humane authority derived from God, to make any Laws in particular about them; no more than to make Laws that one ſhould not fit in the Congregation upon anothers lap, or one ſpit upon anothers cloaths, or face: or that men ſhould not make antick faces in the Church.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Falſe Worſhip.</head>
                     <p>THus much of true Worſhip. Falſe Worſhip is ſuch a ſervice of God as hath no warrant from God himſelf: Worſhip is falſe in matter or manner in whole or in part; neither can the true matter of Worſhip ſanctifie a corrupt manner, or the true manner ſanctifie a corrupt matter, or ſome parts of true Worſhip, or the whole it ſelf, ſanctifie any part of falſe Worſhip that ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to it, or mingled with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatſoever is unholy and ſuperſtitious out of Gods <hi>ſolemn Service,</hi> cannot be made by the ſole appointment and will of man holy and good in the <hi>ſolemn Service</hi> of God, but muſt needs be more unholy and ſuperſtitious therein, and therefore a part of falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If for a man to ſign himſelf or another in the forehead with the <hi>ſign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> out of Baptiſm, be ſuperſtitious and unholy, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119992:11"/> be good in Baptiſm, but a prophane rite.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The more light and to toyiſh the things ſeem to be that without warrant from God, are brought into the Worſhip of God, the more we ſhould abhor conformity unto them, it being a fearful preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſerve God in a toyiſh manner: for who is he that trembles at the Majeſty of God, that dares uſe in his Worſhip any toy and trifle? They are deceived therefore that think that therefore we ſhould not make ſcruple to uſe them becauſe they are toyes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That is a corrupt manner of Worſhip wherein there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and undecency, for all things muſt be done in the Service of God in decency, order and comlineſs, as it is granted; and under the name whereof theſe Ceremonies are obtruded upon us: But thoſe things that are undecent and diſorderly in other matters, and of no neceſſary uſe in Gods Worſhip, cannot be matters of order and decency in the Service of God, except God himſelf ſhould in a ſpecial manner command them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It being therefore confuſion and diſorder in civil matters where a multitude joyns together in a common ſuit and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all to ſpeak at once the ſame words: And common wiſdom and diſcretion having taught it to be a decent and orderly Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that ſome foreman ſhould ſpeak, and the reſt hold their peace, giving only ſome ſign and teſtimony of aſſent: He muſt be more than a man, that muſt make it an orderly thing in our general and ordinary ſuits and prayers to God, for all the Congregation to open their mouths together in a prayer, eſpecially ſith God hath in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appointed the Miniſter to be the mouth of the People, and expreſſely requireth the aſſent of the People only in the word, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. It being a ridiculous diſorder in other matters in any ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where any Deed or Record is to be read or rehearſed, for one to read one period, and another read or ſay another; how can it by mans wit and will, without Ordinance from God, be a matter of order, for the Miniſter to read one verſe of Scripture, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple another; for the Miniſter to ſay one piece of a Prayer, and the People, by way of catch, to ſay ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>her.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If any thing be undecent out of the Worſhip of God (the ſame reaſon of undecency remaining) it is much more undecent in the Worſhip of God; for the more excellent the thing is, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n undecent thing is uſed, the more undecent the thing is that is ſo uſed. As if it be undecent to go naked in any company, it is much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119992:11"/> more undecent to go ſo in the Congregation: If foul apparel be every where elſe undecent, it cannot be decent in Gods Service, though all the Biſhops in the world ſhould decree it.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. An undecent and diſorderly thing the more ſtrictly it is urged in the Service of God, the more dangerous it is to yield unto the ſame, and ſo much the more effectual cauſe of falſe Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If there be ſome apparel that doth in ſpecial manner become the Service of God, and deſerves to be appropriated unto it, then by the ſame poſition there muſt be ſome apparel that doth deform and diſgrace the Service and Worſhip of God: for if no apparel can deform it, then no apparel can be an ornament or decent form un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If any apparel do deform Gods true Worſhip, it is that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that doth moſt beautifie and grace the falſe and Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: As that apparel muſt needs moſt deform a wiſe man that doth moſt adorn a fool, and that apparel muſt needs be moſt unbeſeeming a King, that is ſeemly and decent for a beggar.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If therefore men would ſet their wits upon the higheſt ſtrain to invent an apparel to diſgrace the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they could not invent a more odious attire than the conſecrated attire of a filthy Maſs-Prieſt, the moſt abominable Idolater in the earth.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Thoſe that abhor Idolatry as much as they do beggary and folly, cannot but hate and abhor the badges of Idolatry as much as the badges of folly and beggary, and therefore cannot but account that Prieſtly attire that is enjoyned unto us by our Prelates, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel more unbeſeeming the Miniſter of the Goſpel, than a Cloak with a thouſand patches, or a coat with four elbows, for beggary and folly being judgements and not ſins, the notes of beggary and folly cannot be ſo odious in a ſpiritual eye, as the notes of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. If it be denied, that the apparel enjoyned is Popiſh, becauſe it was before Popery was; this anſwer may be made. 1. It can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be proved that it was before Popery. For though not all Popery, yet ſome Popery was in the Apoſtles times: Moſt of the Hereſies were before the full revealing of Antichriſt, which notwithſtanding we faſten upon them and count popiſh, they having entertained them. If therefore an errour, maintained before Popery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Papiſts, deſerve the name of a popiſh errour, why ſhould not unneceſſary apparel, though uſed before, yet entertained now only by them, and thoſe that receive it from them, bear the name
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119992:12"/> of Popiſh attire? 2. As a coat of divers colours is a fools coat, notwithſtanding that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> one of the twelve Patriarkes, wore one, ſo a white linnen garment is a popiſh garment, though ſome Miniſters in the Eaſt Churches did wear them, and yet it can never be proved, that either they wore ſuch a one as is preſcribed unto us, or that it was a miniſterial garment, and not their ordinary civil at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or proper to the Miniſter only, or if all this, that it was well done: for there being no one Father that wrote ſince the Apoſtles times, but have erred in ſome matters of Doctrine, why may they not as well erre in matters of Ceremony? if all the true Churches of God, beſide our own in <hi>England,</hi> and the greateſt part of the ſufficienteſt Paſtors of our own Church, are held to erre in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral renouncing of theſe Ceremonies; Why might not ſome few Miniſters in the Old Church as well erre in inſtituting and uſing them?</p>
                     <p n="14">14. A corrupt and ſcandalous Ceremony in the Worſhip of God is ſo much the more dangerous and ſcandalous to others, by how much the more it comes graced and countenanced with lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. A corrupt Ceremony enjoyned by a Heatheniſh Pagan and Tyrant unto the Miniſters of the Goſpel living under his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot do ſo much ſpiritual hurt, as when it ſhall be required by a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, for the good conceit of the inſtitutor and ordainor of a religious Rite, is it that breeds Superſtition. Thoſe therefore whoſe ſpecial calling from God is, to edifie the ſouls of men and not to deſtroy them, ought ſo much the more to avoid theſe Ceremonies they judge and know to be ſcandalous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ſouls of men, by how much the greater grace and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance they receive from the Authority of man, neither can the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Magiſtrate be a ſufficient plea at the bar of Gods Judgment Seat for a man that by vertue or force thereof alone, hath done any action (how indifferent ſoever in it ſelf) that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tels him will ſcandalize his brother, and ſo hurt his ſoul; groſs therefore is the Doctrine of them that teach, That <hi>Paul</hi> (if the Magiſtrate had commanded him) ſhould have eaten fleſh, though his brothers ſoul ſhould have been damned for it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The more indifferent an action is in it ſelf, the more odious it ought to be unto us when we ſhall perceive it to hurt our brothers ſoul, which ought to be a thouſand times dearer unto us than his body, or our own lives, for he ſhews neither love nor mercy to his brother, that had rather be the inſtrument of his everlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119992:12"/> than omit the doing of a meer indifferent thing, though he ſhould incur therefore any bodily puniſhment whatſoever. That Form therefore of Gods Service that conſiſts in the uſe of ſuch things indifferent, as experience manifeſteth, are a ſcandal (and by conſequent a deſtruction) to the ſouls of infinite numbers, ought not to be uſed of any, much leſs of thoſe who are called by Chriſt to feed the ſouls of men, and not to deſtroy them. How ſcandalous theſe Ceremonies are to all, how the omiſſion of them cannot be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to any, but unto ſuch as are worſe ſcandalized already by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing them, requires a larger Treatiſe.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. No Magiſtrate that is a Chriſtian will challenge authority to deſtroy the ſoul of any man, and therefore he cannot upon his own meer will and pleaſure, without ſin againſt God, enjoyn any thing (not required by God) that evidently tendeth to the deſtruction of any mans ſoul; and thoſe ſubjects that (being ready to perform any duty that God requireth unto the Magiſtrate) ſhall refuſe to do any ſuch thing ſo required, and ſhall patiently and meekly yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any puniſhment the Magiſtrate ſhall think good to lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them without reſiſtance, ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">A patient ſuffering, when we cannot in conſcience obey, is the beſt obedience.</note> perform more true and loyal obedience unto his authority therein, then any of thoſe that ſhall yield obedience to any Laws of that kind enacted by never ſo good a Magiſtrate, and (in ſhew) to never ſo good an end.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. No ſubject therefore can take any ſuch authority from the hands of the Magiſtrate, which may warrant him to do any thing that ſhall evidently deſtroy his brothers ſoul at any time, much leſs in the Service and Worſhip of God wherein all things that are to be done, ought to tend to the edification of his ſoul in a ſpecial manner.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. It is plain in the Word of God, that the Kingdom of God, (that is) the Service and Worſhip of God, ſtandeth not in meats and drinks, nor any ſuch external Rites having no authority from God. When therefore without any commandment from God, ſuch external things ſhall be brought into the Service of God, and made the very forms of the ſame; ſuch Rites muſt needs be falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that form of Gods Service muſt needs be adulterate, that is made to conſiſt in ſuch things. For no authority can make that a part of Gods Kingdom, that the word of God doth expreſly deny to be a part thereof.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Thoſe Ceremonies therefore in preſent controverſie being meerly by man brought into the Worſhip of God, are by no means
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119992:13"/> to be yielded unto, for it is in effect to make the Kingdom of God to conſiſt in meats and drinks, or in ſuch like things. For if man hath authority to make the Kingdom of God conſiſt in apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he hath alſo authority, if it pleaſe him, to make it conſiſt in eating and drinking, and may make them a part of the Lyturgie, as well as any of thoſe things that are in controverſie.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Thoſe peculiar Rites and Ceremonies which are in that manner and form uſed in the Service of God, that if God himſelf did but ratifie and confirm, that preſent uſe of them ſhould then be parts of his true outward worſhip, muſt needs, as they are uſed, (without Gods Ordinance) be parts of a falſe outward worſhip: But our Surplices, Croſſes, Kneeling at the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſuch, that if God ſhould but command to uſe them as we uſe them, that is, if he ſhould require every Miniſter in Divine Service to wear a Surplice, to note Joy, Dignity or Sanctity, or in Baptiſm to croſs a child, in ſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Theſe Ceremonies therefore, in controverſie having ſuch a uſe in the Service of God, unto which they are peculiarly tied, muſt needs be uſed as parts of Divine worſhip, for elſe the bare ratifying of their preſent uſe could not make them true worſhip; Being therefore (as they are uſed) parts of Divine Worſhip, and not parts of true Divine Worſhip, becauſe not commanded of God; they are parts of falſe Divine VVorſhip, for that Divine VVorſhip that is not true VVorſhip, is falſe VVorſhip.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Thing Indifferent (in the largeſt extent of ſenſe) is any <hi>Mean</hi> between two <hi>Extreams.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Extreams</hi> (properly) are the uttermoſt bounds and limits of any thing, being in direct oppoſition one unto the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To be a <hi>Mean</hi> between two <hi>Extreams,</hi> is ſo to be ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as that it ſtand equally affected to either, enclining no more to the one than to the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hence the Latines call things indifferent, <hi>Res mediae</hi> (middle matters) and that by reaſon of that analogy and proportion that is between them, and thoſe things that in Phyſical or Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dimenſions poſſeſſe the middle place in any line, figure or body: For, that is properly called the middle of any thing, that in poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being as near as can be to both extreams, enclineth no more to the one than to the other, but is alike equally diſtant from both.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And they are therefore called <hi>things indifferent,</hi> becauſe in their relation to thoſe Extreams between which they are ſeated, and unto which they are referred, they ſtand indifferently diſpoſed, and affected to either; whence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> they are called <hi>Adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phora,</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:119992:15"/> unto which our Engliſh term doth preciſely anſwer. For, as that is juſt the middle of a line, that leaveth on both ſides ſo much to either extream, that there is in reſpect of it no difference between the one and the other; but unto it, both are equal and alike: So thoſe things are called <hi>Indifferent</hi> properly, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference, do equally agree unto, or diſſent from thoſe Extreams, unto which they have reference and relation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By all this it may appear that things Indifferent, are not ſuch ſimply in themſelves and of themſelves conſidered, but as they are compared and have relation to the ſaid oppoſite extreams, as the Center in a circle, conſidered in it ſelf and by it ſelf, is not the middle of any thing, but only as it hath reference to the oppoſite extreams in the Circumference: from any of which it is equally diſtant, and in that reſpect only, is it called the <hi>mean</hi> or middle of ſuch a figure.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The very eſſence therefore of a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> conſiſts in that equal and indifferent reference and relation that it hath to ſome two oppoſite terms or extreams, unto which either in ſence or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is compared, and by which only it is meaſured. So that it is in the number of thoſe things that in Schools are called Relatives, all which have only but an accidental being, the Subjects thereof being variable, according to the divers references and reſpects that they have unto divers things. For as a man ſimply conſidered in himſelf, is neither Husband, Father, nor Maſter, but only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Wife, Child and Servant. And as the ſame man in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects may be a Father and a Son, a Maſter and a Servant: So nothing is in and of it ſelf indifferent, but only in relation and reference to ſome oppoſite extreams: And thoſe things which in ſome ſuch reſpect may be indifferent, in ſome other reſpect may be Extreams.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of things more commonly called indifferent.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THough <hi>things Indifferent</hi> may in that former generality, ſpread themſelves to any mediocrity whatſoever: Yet Cuſtom the Miſtreſſe of all ſpeech and language, hath reſtrained and limitted the name to ſuch things only, as are a <hi>Mean</hi> between
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119992:15"/> good and evil. So that (to omit what in rigorous propriety of ſpeech may be comprehended under the name that is given unto them) In common uſe of ſpeech, a thing indifferent is only any mediocrity between good and evil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The proper Extreams therefore of things indifferent, being good and evil, they cannot (retaining the nature of their indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) communicate or partake of either; for whatſoever ſtandeth equally affected to good and evil, cannot in that affection, have in it either good or evil: It being impoſſible, that either of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams ſhould be found in the <hi>Mean,</hi> without deſtruction of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whatſoever then void of all evil,<note n="a" place="margin">Such they ſay are our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. For thoſe things are good that are decent, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly &amp; means of edification.</note> participateth but the leaſt meaſure of good; or void of all good, partaketh but the<note n="b" place="margin">Such we ſay and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be.</note> leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of evil, cannot bear the name of a thing <hi>indifferent:</hi> for there can be no indifferency in that, which inclineth more to the one extream, than to the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A thing indifferent therefore being a <hi>mean,</hi> between good and evil, it is<note n="c" place="margin">So are not theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> ſo ſeated between them, that it is as far removed from good, as a thing not evil can be; and as far removed from evil as a thing not good can be, and as near unto good and evil, as any thing can be, that is neither good nor evil. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Indifferent, is neither good nor evil, whatſoever is either good or evil, is not indifferent, whatſoever is not indifferent is either good or evil.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Things <hi>Indifferent</hi> being equally divided from good and evil, are in like manner divided from all the properties of either; For every property being unſeparable from that ſubject, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof it ſpringeth, no one can be communicated to any thing, but unto that, unto which the ſubject it ſelf communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelf: If therefore the property of any Extream be found in a thing Indifferent, the Extream it ſelf is to be found likewiſe therein. Which to imagin, is as abſurd, as to look to find the Circumference of a Circle in the Center.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. No indifferent thing therefore as it is an indifferent thing,<note n="d" place="margin">But they ſay that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie have. For that which is a grace and ornament to good, maketh the better.</note> hath power to make any thing good or evil, better or worſe: For it is the property only of good and evil, either to make or increaſe good or evil in any thing.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That<note n="e" place="margin">But ſuch are the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</note> which doth more hurt or good, than ſome things that are good or evil, is not indifferent, but either good or evil: for nothing but good can exceed in goodneſs that which is good; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119992:16"/> nothing but evil, can exceed in hurt, that which is evil.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Whatſoever<note n="f" place="margin">This do the ceremonies in controverſie.</note> worketh upon any affection of man, ſtirring up in him love, hatred, delight, ſorrow, zeal, malice, envy, jealouſie, hope, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be apprehended as a thing indifferent, by him in whom theſe paſſions are wrought. For it is the property only of thoſe things that preſent themſelves as good or evil, to beget and move ſuch paſſions in the ſoul of man. For it is impoſſible that a thing indifferent apprehended as a thing indifferent ſhould beget any thing in the ſoul of man but Indifferency, and a Stoical apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or ſenceleſſeneſs: So that whatſoever a<note n="g" place="margin">As our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates do the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> man intirely loveth and delighteth in, admireth, commendeth, purſueth with zeal, commandeth with authority. Whatſoever alſo a man ſhall abhor, condemn, forbid, puniſh, perſecute, he cannot in any ſincerity affirm, that he judgeth that thing to be indifferent, but to be in ſome degree either good or evil.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The omiſſion of that is indifferent, the commiſſion whereof is indifferent: and that whoſe<note n="h" place="margin">Such is the omiſſion of our ceremonies ſaid to be, and that in a high degree.</note> omiſſion is evil, is certainly good.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. All the former Premiſes conſidered, this muſt needs follow, That<note n="i" place="margin">To command our ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as they ſay, a great good, yea a publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good.</note> to command a thing indifferent, is to command no good; to forbid a thing indifferent, is to forbid no evil.<note n="k" place="margin">But to uſe the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is to do much good, if they edify the ſoul.</note> To do a thing indifferent, is to do no good: To forbear a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<note n="l" place="margin">None are more ſpitefully intreated than thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and therefore ſure therein they do much evil.</note> is to do no evil. And therefore to puniſh for a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, is to puniſh for no evil.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of things Indifferent in special.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THE Eſſence of things <hi>Indifferent,</hi> conſiſting in a meer and equal privation of Good and Evil, there cannot be given any true kinds or degrees of them: For all privatives conſidered in themſelves, are of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though there be no true kinds of them, yet they may be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried according to the diverſity of thoſe Extreams with which they are compared: And therefore may be diſtinguiſhed according to the common diſtinctions of good and evil.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That good that hath not an evil oppoſite unto it in the ſame kind, cannot be the Extream of any thing <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119992:16"/> cannot vary, diſtinguiſh, or denominate a thing indifferent. As, if there be not an oppoſite colour unto white, then it is impoſſible to imagine how white ſhould be an extream to any other colour, or any other colour a mean unto it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which is properly a mean, muſt agree with the extreams in all things in which the extreams do agree: for Example, If black and white be both of them colours, that which is properly a mean between black and white muſt be a colour alſo; for it were abſurd to call any thing but a colour, a mean between black and white: ſo that the mean followes the common natures and qualities of both the extreams, for as it is ſaid before, That onely is a mean that is not only equally diſtant from two extreams, but withall is as neer to both as may be, which cannot be verified of that mean that ſhall not be found to agree with the extreams in thoſe things wherein the extreams do agree within themſelves, and therefore things indifferent follow their extreams. As therefore that cannot be an extream that hath not in the ſame kind an oppoſite, ſo that can be no <hi>medium</hi> to any extreams, that doth diſſent from them in that wherein they ſhall accord and agree. So that that denomination and predication that belongs to both extreams, belongs alſo to their <hi>mean.</hi> The mean between two oppoſite Qualities is a quality; between two ſubſtances, a ſubſtance; between two actions an action; between two goods a good; between two evils an evil; between two quantities a quantity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hence it will follow, that no<note n="a" place="margin">All ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces therefore are indifferent only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in reſpect of ſome uſe.</note> ſubſtance (as it is a ſubſtance) can be called a thing indifferent, becauſe that there is no ſubſtance that is evil as it is a ſubſtance. For an indifferent ſubſtance, muſt needs (if there were any ſuch) be a mean between a good and an evil ſubſtance. If then there be no evil ſubſtances, it cannot be imagined how there ſhould be any indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The like may be ſaid of all<note n="b" place="margin">As alſo of all artificial which imitate natures.</note> created ſpecies and kindes of things, conſidered not only in their ſubſtances, but qualities and diſpoſitions. For the voice of God pronouncing them all to be good, none of them are evil: and if none of them be evil, none are indifferent. For indifferent created things can have no place, either real, or imaginative, but between a created good, and a created evil. There is therefore no Creature of God, nor no created property or quality of any creature, that is by creation a Thing Indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Alſo upon the ſaid grounds it appears, that there is no
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119992:17"/>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">And therefore there cannot be made an abſolute and perpetual law concerning any thing, under the name of indifferent; for a law bindeth only to good, and puniſheth for evil: and therefore to imagine a law that bindeth to the doing of a thing indifferent, when that thing indifferent turns evil, as the moſt indifferent thing may, then the force of the law ceaſeth.</note> abſolute <hi>Indifferent thing,</hi> becauſe there is nothing in nature either abſolutely good, or abſolutely evil: In being impoſſible that any thing ſhould be an abſolute <hi>Mean,</hi> whoſe extreams are not abſolute, for where one extream is abſolute, and the other not abſolute, the Mean cannot be abſolute; for if it be, it enclineth more to one extream than the other, which is to deſtroy the nature of a thing indifferent.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THings Indifferent therefore, being to be diſtinguiſhed according to thoſe diſtinctions of Good and Evil that are equally common to them both, we are in the next place diſtinctly to propound the ſame, and by them accordingly to diſtinguiſh the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Firſt therefore Good and Evil is ſuch, either in appearance only, or indeed alſo. Whence ariſeth the firſt diſtinction of <hi>things indifferent,</hi> for accordingly ſome things are indifferent in appearance only, ſome indeed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Thing indifferent in appearance only, is that which is a <hi>mean</hi> between that Good and Evil<note place="margin">Conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rites of an Idolatrous Religion and Worſhip, be not at leaſt an evil in appearance and ſhew, and therefore cannot be ſo much as in appearance indifferent.</note> that is in ſhew and appearance only. For that appeareth to be indifferent, that being good or evil indeed, appeareth or ſeemeth to be neither.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A thing indifferent indeed, is that which is a Mean between thoſe things that are in truth and verity Good or Evil. So that ſuch an indifferent is void of all true good,<note n="b" place="margin">If our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were ſuch, the Devil and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and all ſuperſtitious and lewd perſons would not ſo much dote upon them, and the hearts of ſo many learned and godly men would not burn againſt them as they do.</note> and evil.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As that which is good in appearance only, is indeed either
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119992:17"/> evil or indifferent, and that which is evil in appearance only, is indeed either good or indifferent; and that which is indifferent in appearance only, is indeed either good or evil: So that which is indifferent indeed, is in truth, neither good nor evil.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. LAſtly, Good and Evil is either Corporall, in reſpect of the body; or Spiritual, in reſpect of the minde; In which reſpect Things Indifferent do alwayes vary.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Thing Indifferent in reſpect of the body, is any ſuch thing that applyed to the body, doth it neither good nor hurt. As that which maketh a man neither rich nor poor, ſtrong nor weak, beautifull nor deformed, hungry nor yet ſatisfied, ſick nor healthy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That may be Good<note n="a" place="margin">Circumſtances of time and place do alſo vary the things of this kind exceedingly. For that in ſome time, and ſome place, is indifferent to ſome body, that in another place, and at another time is good or evil.</note> to the body in one reſpect, that is Evil in another, <hi>&amp; contrà;</hi> and that may be indifferent unto it in one reſpect, that is good or evil in another: Alſo that may be good or evil to one part of the body that is indifferent to another part: And a thing may be indifferent to one, that is good or evil to another.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A thing indifferent in reſpect of the <hi>minde</hi> or ſoul, is whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever having reference and relation to the ſoul,<note n="b" place="margin">Either indeed or appearance of it ſelf, or accident, actually or potentially.</note> doth it neither good nor hurt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Goods and Evils of ſoul, are either diſpoſitions, qualities, or habits in the ſoul, or ſuch actions as proceed from them, As thoughts, words, deeds; all which are called moral. A <hi>Moral good</hi> is whatſoever in Man or from man is agreeable and correſpondent to the Law of Nature, Reaſon, or the Divine Law of God revealed ſupernaturally in his word; unto this head are to be referred, all true wiſdom, knowledg, underſtanding, providence, diſcretion, and all actions flowing from the ſame; Alſo all Moral vertues, as, Juſtice, Temperance, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all the Actions proceeding from them, all which are ſquared and ruled by ſome or other of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119992:19"/> former Laws. A Moral evil is whatſoever is any waies repugnant (whether in general or particular) to any of thoſe former Laws. As Ignorance, Folly, Injuſtice, Intemperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all Actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe things are in a Moral reſpect indifferent (whether they be Qualities, Inclinations, Habits or Actions) That have in them<note n="c" place="margin">See cha. 8. ſect 4. marg.</note> neither <hi>vertue nor vice.</hi> Herein ſuch Actions of mans will are moſt frequent, that are neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. There is no Action of mans will ſo indifferent<note n="d" place="margin">So that (by Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) a man may by taking up a ſtraw or a ruſh commit a Moral vice. For example, if he ſhould uſe to do it in the time of prayer.</note> but the doing thereof (by ſome circumſtance) may be repugnant to the Law of God, and by conſequent be hurtful to the ſoul of man.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. An Action that in ſome one reſpect unto ſomeone ſpecial Law, is Indifferent, in reſpect of ſome other Law may be Good or Evil. As that action may be either Religious or Superſtitious, that hath in it neither Temperancy nor Intemperancy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Any action done by man that is not commanded<note n="e" place="margin">Such are the Ceremonies in Controverſie: They are no where in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or ſpecial commanded, no more then the ſhaven on crown and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, and yet they have been and are the ſpecial means and occaſion of the Schiſm of many hundred Browniſts.

Alſo, (if it be a ſin to diſlike our Lords ſpiritual) there is no one greater cauſe that moveth thoſe that the prophane call Puritans to do it, then theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which if they might be freed from, as all other reformed Churches are, there is no other Civil obedience or ſubjection due unto them, that they would refuſe to perform, in as low a degree as any other whatſoever.</note> by God, either expreſly or by direct conſequent, that is a means either of it ſelf or by accident of any hurt either to the body or ſoul of a mans ſelf, or of his Neighbour, either by bringing evill into them, or nouriſhing or encreaſing evill in them, cannot bear the name of an Indifferent action; For there is no indifferency in that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not required of God (and therefore is not Good) doth hurt (any waies) a man: which muſt needs be againſt the Law of God.

                     <p n="12">12. There is no Action<note n="f" place="margin">What honour receiveth God by our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? It is certain that Antichriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth great honour by them.</note> that a man can do by the power of his will, but either in it ſelf, or by accident, it doth either glorifie or diſhonour God, and therefore no action, in reſpect of God, is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely indifferent, but thereby God receiveth ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſhonour.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. All Actions of Religion (amongſt which<note n="g" place="margin">Such are the Ceremonies and Rites that are peculiarly acted in Divine Worſhip, if they be good and lawful.</note> thoſe are ſpecial that are peculiarly done in Divine Service) are (if they be as they ought to be) in a ſpecial manner good, tending more directly to the glory of God than any other Actions, therefore no Action of Religion, whether it be Moral or Ceremoniall, is indifferent, but either good or evil.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. No Action of Religion, whether Moral or Ceremonial,<note n="h" place="margin">Such are our Ceremonies elſe they are not indifferent.</note> grounded only upon the will of man, and not upon the Word of God, can bring any ſpecial glory to God, and therefore no ſuch Act can be an Act of Religion, but of Superſtition, and therefore cannot be indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. There being ſome myſtical Ceremonies of Religion Good, and ſome Evil. If there be any myſtical Ceremonies indifferent, they muſt then in ſome ſpecial and material point differ from the Evil, even as far as from the good. But there is no myſtical Rite of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion<note n="i" place="margin">Croſſing in Baptiſm being no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor no leſs forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den then brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon the child, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as evill. It muſt needs come nearer to theſe, than it doth to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which is commanded.</note> but doth come many degrees nearer to the evil than to the good. And therefore there can be no myſtical Rite of Religion indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. An evil Ceremony of Religion being therefore only evil becauſe it is forbidden of God: A good Ceremony of religion is therefore only a good Ceremony becauſe it is commanded of God: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t muſt be an indifferent Ceremony that is neither forbidden nor commanded: But all Ceremonies in Religion that are not good, are evil, and therefore there are no indifferent Ceremonies of Religion.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. As no man by his ſole will can make that Ceremony good in Divine Worſhip that God forbiddeth to be done therein, or make that evil that God commandeth to be done therein. So can he not make that which is but indifferent to be good: For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make that to be commanded of God that is forbidden of God; Or that which (though it be not forbidden) is not commanded: If therefore what Ceremony of Religion ſoever is good be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119992:20"/> of God; and if every Ceremony of Religion ought to be good, and if whatſoever Ceremony is commanded of God is not Indifferent, hence it will follow: That no Ceremony of Religion is indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Thus much of Actions indifferent having reference to God. Thoſe actions of man are indifferent in reſpect of a mans ſelf, or his neighbour, that being committed, bring neither moral hurt nor good unto himſelf, or them. For thoſe actions are evill to the doer, and ſuch as hurt his ſoul, that are a means of bringing either upon himſelf or upon his neighbour any evill forbidden. And thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are good to his ſoul, that are a means of affecting with any good commanded himſelf or his neighbour.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Whatſoever therefore, doing a man no good, is a means ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to<note n="k" place="margin">But we ſhall be ready to prove, that ſuch is the Law that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires theſe Ceremonies.</note> take from a man any good thing that God hath freely granted unto him, as Life, Health, Liberty, Name, honeſty, Piety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or to bring upon a man that evil that God otherwiſe withholdeth from him, that cannot be indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. All ſuch humane Laws therefore, that<note n="l" place="margin">Much more thoſe Laws that lay greater penalties upon the omiſſion of ſome Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than the omiſſion of the greateſt good, or commiſſion of the groſſeſt evil, as do the Canons and Laws that require theſe Ceremonies.</note> upon any penalties, bind men to thoſe things that are confeſſed indifferent, which are ſuch things as God hath left to the free liberty of man to do, or not to<note n="m" place="margin">This hindereth not, but that the Magiſtrate may, and ought (if it be for the good of the Commonweal) command fiſh daies, and ſuch like the neglect whereof may do much hurt, and the obſervation much good, for in ſuch caſes eating of fiſh and fleſh is not a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but that which men ſtand bound either to forbear, or to do according to the Civil Laws of Magiſtrates.</note> do, is a depriving of men of that liberty that God hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, and therefore ſuch a Law is neither good nor indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but evil to the ſoul of him that enacteth it, though not of him that obeyeth it. For it is no indifferency in any man to take that away from a man that God hath freely given unto him.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. All moral actions of men that are good or evill, are either private, or common and publike: The common and publike are either Domeſtical, Political, or Eccleſiaſtical. Actions alſo in their Indifferency may vary according to their divers references to theſe.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. A private good or evil action, is that which affecteth with good or evill only a mans own perſon that doth it, and which ſpreadeth not to the good or hurt of any other (except ſecondarily and by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident) as he that eateth and drinketh) doth himſelf only good
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119992:20"/> properly: Though ſecondarily and by accident, he may, in that ſtrength he receiveth, thereby do his Family or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth good.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. That action is indifferent, in reſpect of a mans private ſelf, that doth his own private Perſon any good or hurt.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Thoſe Domeſtical, Political, Eccleſiaſtical actions are good or evil, that tend to the good or hurt of a Family, Commonwealth, or Church; and thoſe are indifferent, that, being done, do bring neither good nor hurt, or as much good as hurt unto any of the ſaid Societies.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. That may be good, evil, or indifferent to a private perſon, as he is a private perſon, that is not ſo unto a Family, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or Church, or unto him, as he is a member of all or any of them.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. That may be Indifferent to be done by a Family, or the Commonwealth, as it is ſuch, That is evil and not indifferent to be done by a Church.

                     <p n="27">27. All which premiſes, or the moſt of them, being granted, it will eaſily appear, to any that can rightly apply theſe principles and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſertions, that the Ceremonies, in preſent controverſie in our Church, are not (as is pretended by the forcers of them) meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent, but either excellent parts of our Religion, or noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of Superſtition.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They hold</hi> that all ſuch Churches or Congregations, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating after that manner together, in divine worſhip, are in all Eccleſiaſtical matters equal, and of the ſame power and authority; and that by the Word and will of God they ought to have the ſame ſpiritual Priviledges, Prerogatives, Officers, Adminiſtrations, Orders, and Formes of Divine worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They hold</hi> that Chriſt Jeſus hath not ſubjected any Church or Congregation of his, to any other ſuperior Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, than unto that which is within it ſelf: So that if a whole Church or Congregation ſhall erre, in any matters of faith or Religion, no other Churches, or ſpiritual Church-Officers have (by any warrant from the Word of God) power to cenſure, puniſh, or controle the ſame; but are only to counſel and adviſe the ſame, and ſo to leave their ſoules to the immediate judgment of Chriſt, and their bodies to the ſword and power of the Civil Magiſtrate, who alone upon earth hath power to puniſh a whole Church or Congregation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They hold</hi> that every eſtabliſhed Church or Congregation ought to have her own ſpiritual officers &amp; miniſters, reſident with her, &amp; thoſe ſuch as are injoyned by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, and no other.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>They hold</hi> that every eſtabliſhed Church ought (as a ſpecial prerogative by which ſhe is indowed by Chriſt) to have power and liberty to elect and chuſe their own ſpiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Officers; and that it is a greater wrong to have any ſuch forced upon them againſt their wills, than if they ſhould force upon men wives, and upon women husbands againſt their will and liking.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>They hold</hi> that if in this choice any particular Churches ſhall erre, that none upon earth but the Civil Magiſtrate hath power to controle or correct them for it: And that though it be not lawfull for him to take away this power from them, yet, when they or any of them ſhall apparently abuſe the ſame, he ſtands bound by the Law of God, and by vertue of his Office (grounded upon the ſame,)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119992:24"/> to puniſh them ſeverely for it, and to force them under civil mulcts to make better choice.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>They hold</hi> that the Eccleſiaſtical Officers and Miniſters of one Church ought not to bear any Eccleſiaſtical Office in another, but ought to be tyed unto that Congregation of which they are members, and by which they are elected into office: And they are not, (without juſt cauſe, and ſuch as may be approved by the Congregation) to forſake their Callings; wherein if the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be perverſe, and will not hearken to reaſon, They are then to crave the aſſiſtance and help of the Civil Magiſtrate, who alone hath power, and who ought by his Civil Sword, and Authority, procure to all Members of the Church, whether their Governors, or others, freedome from all manifeſt injuries and wrongs.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>They hold</hi> that the Congregation having once made choice of their ſpiritual Officers, unto whom they commit the Regiment of their Soules, they ought not (without juſt cauſe, and that which is apparently warrantable by the Word of God) to diſcharge, deprive, or depoſe them; but ought to live in all Canonical obedience and ſubjection unto them, agreeable to the Word of God: And if by permiſſion of the Civil Magiſtrate, they ſhall by other Eccleſiaſtical Officers, be ſuſpended, or deprived, for any cauſe in their apprehenſion good and juſtifiable by the Word of God, then they hold it the bounden duty of the Congregation to be continual ſuppliants to God, and humble ſuters unto Civil Authority for the reſtauration of them unto their Adminiſtrations, which if it cannot be obtained, yet this much honour they are to give unto them, as to acknowledge them to the death, their ſpiritual Guides and Governors, though they be rigorouſly deprived of their Miniſtry and Service.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>They hold</hi> that though one Church is not to differ from another, in any Spiritual, Eccleſiaſtical, or Religious matters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but are to be equal and alike; yet, that they may differ, and one excel another in outward Civil Circumſtances, of place, time, Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that although they hold that thoſe Congregations of which Kings and Nobles make themſelves members, ought to have the ſame Eccleſiaſtical Officers, Miniſtry, worſhip, Sacraments, Ceremonies, and Forme of Divine Worſhip, that the baſeſt Congregation in the Country hath, and no other; yet they hold alſo, That as their Perſons in civil reſpects excel, ſo in the Exerciſes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119992:24"/> of Religion in civil matters they may excel other Aſſemblies, Their Chappels and Seats may be gorgeouſly ſet forth, with rich Arras and Tapeſtry, their Fonts may be of Silver, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Tables of Ivory, and if they will, covered with gold; the Cup out of which they drink the Sacramental blood of Chriſt may be of beaten gold ſet about with Diamonds; their Miniſters may be clothed in ſilk and velvet, ſo themſelves will maintain them in that manner; otherwiſe, they think it abſurd and againſt common reaſon, that other baſe and Inferior Congregations muſt by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Tithes and Oblations, maintain the ſilken and velvet ſuits, and Lordly retinue of the Miniſters, and Eccleſiaſtical Officers of Princes and Nobles.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>They hold</hi> that the Lawes, Orders, and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the viſible Churches of Chriſt, if they be lawfull and warrantable by the Word of God, are no wayes repugnant to any Civil State whatſoever; whether Monarchical, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical, but do tend to the further eſtabliſhing and advancing of the Rights and Prerogatives of all and every of them: And they renounce and abhor from their ſoules all ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or Policy, that is any way repugnant and derogatory to any of them, eſpecially to the Monarchical State, which they acknowledg to be the beſt kind of Civil Government for this Kingdome.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning the Miniſters of the Word.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>THey hold</hi> that the Paſtors of particular Congregations are, or ought to be the higheſt Spiritual Officers in the Church, over whom, (by any Divine Ordinance) there is no ſuperiour Paſtor but only Jeſus Chriſt: And that they are led by the ſpirit of Antichriſt, that arrogate or take upon themſelves to be Paſtors of Paſtors.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They hold</hi> that there are not by any Divine Inſtitution in the word, any ordinary, National, Provincial, or Dioceſan Paſtors or Miniſters under which the Paſtors of particular Congregations are to be ſubject, as Inferior Officers. And that if there were any ſuch, that then the Word of God would have ſet them down more diſtinctly and preciſely than any of the reſt: For the higher place that one occupieth in the Church, of the more neceſſity he is unto the Church; of the more neceſſity he is to the Church, the more carefully would Chriſt (the head of the Church) have been in pointing him out, and diſtinguiſhing him from other. Hence, in the Old Teſtament, the High Prieſt, his Title, Office, Function and ſpecial Adminiſtration and Juriſdiction is more particularly and preciſely ſet down, than the Office of any of the Inferior Prieſts and Levites. Alſo in the New Teſtament, the Office of a Paſtor is more diſtinctly, and more preciſely ſet down, than of a Doctor, or any other inferior Church-Officer: So that a man may as well call into queſtion the whole New Teſtament, as doubt whether there ought to be a Paſtor in every Congregation, or doubt of his proper Office and Function. And if by Gods Ordinance there ſhould be an ordinary Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Officer above the Paſtors of particular congregations, than Chriſt out of all queſtion would with that ſpecial care and coſt have ſet it forth, by Titles, prerogatives, peculiar Offices, Functions, and Gifts, that the Churches and people of God ſhould have reaſon rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119992:25"/> Paſtors, that then alſo Chriſt (as he did in the Jewiſh Church) would have appointed a ſolemn National or Provincial Liturgy or worſhip, unto which at ſometimes of the year, the whole body of the people ſhould aſcend, and that unto the Metropolitan City, as unto a <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that he would (as he did in the Jewiſh Church) more preciſely and particularly have ſet down the manner of ſolemnization thereof, than of his parochial worſhip: Foraſmuch therefore as they cannot read in the New Teſtament of any higher or more ſolemn worſhip, than of that which is to be performed in a particular Congregation, they cannot be perſwaded, that God hath appointed any higher Miniſters of his ſervice and worſhip under the New Teſtament, than the elect Miniſters of particular Congregations.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They hold</hi> that the High Prieſt of the Jews, was typically and in a figure, the ſupream head of the whole Catholique Church, which though it were viſible only in the Province and Nation of <hi>Jury,</hi> yet thoſe of other Nations and Countries (as appears by the Hiſtory of <hi>Acts,</hi> even though they were Ethiopians,) were under this High Prieſt, and acknowledged homage unto him. So that he was not a Provincial Metropolitane, but in very deed, an Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical and univerſal Biſhop of the whole world. And therefore they hold, (this being the beſt ground in the word, for Metropolitane and Provincial Paſtors or Biſhops,) that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who alone maketh claim unto, and is in poſſeſſion of the like univerſal Supremacy, hath more warrant in the Word of God, to the ſame, than any Metropolitane or Dioceſan (not dependant upon him) hath or can have. So that they hold, that by the Word of God, either there muſt be no Metropolitanes and Dioceſans, or elſe there muſt be a Pope.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>They hold</hi> That no Paſtor ought to exerciſe or accept of any Civil publique Juriſdiction and authority, but ought to be wholly imployed in ſpiritual Offices and Duties to that Congregation over which he is ſet. And that thoſe Civil Magiſtrates weaken their own Supremacy, that ſhall ſuffer any Eccleſiaſtical Paſtor to exerciſe any Civil Juriſdiction within their Realms, Dominions, or Seigniories.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the higheſt and ſupream Office and authority of the Paſtor, is to preach the Goſpel ſolemnly and publickly to the Congregation, by interpreting the written Word of God, and applying the ſame by exhortation and reproof unto them. They
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119992:26"/> hold, that this was the greateſt work that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did; and that whoſoever is thought worthy and fit to exerciſe this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, cannot be thought unfit and unworthy to exerciſe any other ſpiritual or Eccleſiaſtical authority whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>They hold</hi> that the Paſtor or Miniſter of the Word, is not to reach any Doctrine unto the Church, grounded upon his own judgment or opinion, or upon the Judgment or opinion of any or all the men in the world; but only that truth that he is able to demonſtrate and prove evidently, and apparently, by the Word of God ſoundly interpreted; and that the people are not bound to believe any Doctrine of Religion or Divinity whatſoever, upon any ground whatſoever, except it be apparently juſtified by the Word, or by neceſſary conſequent deduced from the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>They hold</hi> that in interpreting the Scriptures, and opening the ſence of them, he ought to follow thoſe Rules only that are followed in finding out the meaning of other writings, to wit, by weighing the propriety of the tongue wherein they are written, by weighing the Circumſtance of the place, by comparing one place with another, and by conſidering what is properly ſpoken and what tropically or figuratively. And they hold it unlawfull for the Paſtor to obtrude upon his people a ſence of any part of the Divine Word, for which he hath no other ground but the bare teſtimonies of men; and that it is better for the people to be content to be ignorant of the meaning of ſuch difficult places, than to hang their Faith in any matter in this caſe upon the bare Teſtimony of man.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>They hold</hi> that the people of God ought not to acknowledge any ſuch for their Paſtors, as are not able by Preaching, to interpret and apply the Word of God unto them in manner and forme afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: And therefore that no ignorant, and ſole reading Prieſts are to be reputed the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſendeth none into his Miniſtry and ſervice, but ſuch as he adorneth in ſome meaſure with ſpiritual gifts. And they cannot be perſwaded that the faculty of reading in ones Mother tongue the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which any ordinary Turk or Infidel hath, can be called in any congruity of ſpeech, a Miniſterial gift of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>They hold</hi> that in the Aſſembly of the Church, the Paſtor only is to be the mouth of the Congregation to God in Prayer, and that the people are only to teſtifie their aſſent by the word <hi>Amen.</hi> And that it is a Babilonian cofuſion, for the Paſtor to ſay one piece
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119992:26"/> of a Prayer, and the people with mingled voices to ſay another; except in ſinging, which by the very ordinance and inſtinct of nature, is more delightfull, and effectual, the more voices there are joyned and mingled together in harmony and conſent.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>They hold</hi> that the Church hath no authority to impoſe upon her Paſtors or any other of her Officers, any other miniſterial Duties, Offices, Functions, Actions or Ceremonies, ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="12">12. <hi>They hold</hi> that it is as great an injury to force a Congregation or Church to maintain as their Paſtor, with Tithes, and ſuch like Donations, that perſon that either is not able to inſtruct them, or that refuſeth in his own perſon ordinarily to do it, as to force a man to maintain one for his wife, that either is not a woman, or that refuſeth in her own perſon to do the duties of a wife unto him.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>They hold</hi> that by Gods Ordinance there ſhould be alſo in every Church, a Doctor, whoſe ſpecial office ſhould be to inſtruct, by way of Catechizing, the Ignorant of the Congregation (and that particularly) in the main grounds and Principles of Religion.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>THey hold</hi> that the ſpiritual keyes of the Church are by Chriſt, committed to the aforeſaid ſpiritual Officers and Governors, and unto none other: which keyes they hold that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119992:27"/> they are not to be put to this uſe, to lock up the Crowns, Swords, or Scepters of Princes and Civil States, or the Civil Rights, Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and Immunities, of Civil Subjects in the things of this Life, or to uſe them as picklocks to open withal mens Treaſuries and Coffers, or as keyes of Priſons, to ſhut up the bodies of men; for they think that ſuch a Power and Authority Eccleſiaſtical is fit only for the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the conſecrated Governours of his Synagogues, who having no Word of God, which is the Sword of the Spirit, to defend his and their uſurped Juriſdiction over the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, doth unlawfully uſurp the lawful Civil Sword and Power of the Monarchs and Princes of the Earth, thereby forcing men to ſubject themſelves to his ſpiritual vaſſalage and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and abuſing thereby the ſpiritual Keyes and Juriſdiction of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They hold that by vertue of theſe Keyes, they are not to make any curious Inquiſitions into the ſecret or hidden vices or crimes of men, extorting from them a confeſſion of thoſe faults that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from themſelves and others: or to proceed to moleſt any man upon ſecret ſuggeſtions, private ſuſpition, or uncertain fame, or for ſuch crimes as are in queſtion whether they be crimes or no; But they are to proceed only againſt evident and apparent crimes, ſuch as are either granted to be ſuch of all civil honeſt men: or of all true Chriſtians, or at leaſt ſuch, as they are able, by evidence of the Word of God, to convince to be ſins to the conſcience of the Offender; As alſo, ſuch as have been either publikely committed, or having been committed in ſecret, are by ſome good means brought to light, and which the delinquent denying, they are able by honeſt and ſufficient teſtimony to prove againſt him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They hold,</hi> that when he that hath committed a ſcandalous crime cometh before them, and is convinced of the ſame, they ought not (after the manner of our Eccleſiaſtical Courts) ſcorn, deride, taunt and revile him with odious and contumelious ſpeeches; eye him with big and ſtern looks, procure Proctors to make Perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt him, make him dance attendance from Court day to Court day, and from Term to Term, frowning at him in preſence, and laughing at him behind his back: but they are (though he be never ſo obſtinate and perverſe) to uſe him brotherly, not giving the leaſt perſonal reproaches, or threats, (but laying open unto him the nature of his ſin by the light of Gods Word) are only by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the judgements of God againſt him, to terrifie him, and ſo to move him to repentance.</p>

                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119992:28"/>4. <hi>They hold,</hi> that if the party offending be their civil Superiour, that then they are to uſe, even throughout the whole carriage of their Cenſure, all civil Complements, Offices and Reverence due unto him; That they are not to preſume to convent him before them, but are themſelves to go in all civil and humble manner unto him, to ſtand bare before him, to bow unto him, to give him all civil Titles belonging unto him; and, if he be a King and Supream Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, they are to kneel down before him, and in the humbleſt manner to cenſure his faults, ſo that he may ſee apparently that they are not carried with the leaſt ſpice of malice againſt his Perſon, but only with zeal of the health and ſalvation of his ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Eccleſiaſtical Officers, laying to the charge of any man any Errour, Hereſie, or falſe Opinion whatſoever, do ſtand bound themſelves, firſt, to prove that he holdeth ſuch an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or hereſie; and ſecondly, to prove directly unto him that it is an errour by the Word of God, and that it deſerveth ſuch a cenſure, before they do proceed againſt him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Governours of the Church ought with all patience and quietneſs hear what every Offender can poſſibly ſay for himſelf, either for Qualification, Defence, Apology, or Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſuppoſed crime or errour whatſoever; and they ought not to proceed to cenſure the groſſeſt offence that is, untill the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender have ſaid as much for himſelf in his defence as he poſſibly is able. And they hold it an evident Character of a corrupt Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government, where the parties convented may not have full liberty to ſpeak for themſelves, conſidering, that the more liberty is granted to ſpeak in a bad cauſe, (eſpecially before thoſe that are in Authority, and of judgment,) the more the iniquity of it will appear, and the more the Juſtice of their Sentence will ſhine.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> whereby Popiſh and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Eccleſiaſtical Governours, either upon ſome ſecret informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſuggeſtions, or private ſuſpitions, go about to bind mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to accuſe themſelves and their friends of ſuch crimes or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations as cannot by any direct courſe of Law be proved againſt them, and whereby they are drawn to be inſtruments of many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy croſſes upon themſelves and their friends, and that often for thoſe Actions that they are perſwaded in their conſciences are good and holy; (I ſay) that they hold that ſuch an Oath (on the urgers part) is moſt damnable and tyrannous, againſt the very Law of Nature, deviſed by Antichriſt, through the inſpiration of the devil, that by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119992:28"/> means thereof, the profeſſors and practizers of the true Religion, might either in their weakneſs, by per jury, damn their own ſouls, or be drawn to reveal to the Enemies of Chriſtianity, thoſe ſecret reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious acts and deeds, that being (in the perſwaſion of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences) for the advancement of the Goſpel, will be a means of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſentences of condemnation againſt themſelves and their deareſt friends.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>They hold,</hi> that Eccleſiaſtical Officers have no power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Cenſure againſt any Crime of any Perſon, after that he ſhall freely acknowledge the ſame, and profeſs his hearty penitency for it: And that they may not, for any crime whatſoever, lay any bodily or pecuniary mulct upon them, or impoſe upon them any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Mark or Note of ſhame, ſuch as is the white ſheet, or any ſuch like; or take any fees for any cauſe whatſoever, but are to accept of, as a ſufficient ſatisfaction, a private ſubmiſſion and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Crime be private, and a publike, if the crime be publike and notorious.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>They hold,</hi> that if a Member of the Church be obſtinate, and ſhew no ſigns and tokens of repentance of that crime, that they by evidence of Scripture have convinced to be a crime, that then by their Eccleſiaſtical Authority they are to deny unto him the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper. And if the ſuſpenſion from it will not humble him, then (though not without humbling themſelves in prayer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and great demonſtration of ſorrow for him) they are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him to be as ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Officers of the Church are not to proceed unto the extreameſt Cenſure againſt any man, without the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole Congregation it ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>THey hold,</hi> that the Civil Magiſtrate, as he is a Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath, and ought to have Supream power over all the Churches within his Dominions, in all cauſes whatſoever; and yet they hold, that as he is a Chriſtian, he is a Member of ſome one particular Congregation, and ought to be as ſubject to the ſpiritual Regiment thereof preſcribed by Chriſt in his Word, as the meaneſt ſubject in the Kingdom; and they hold, that this Subjection is no more derogatory to his Supremacy, than the Subjection of his body in ſickneſs to Phyſitians, can be ſaid to be derogatory thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>They hold,</hi> that thoſe Civill Magiſtrates are the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their own Supremacie, that in whole or in part, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the virtue and power thereof to any Eccleſiaſtical Officers.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They hold,</hi> that there ſhould be no Eccleſiaſtical Officer in the Church ſo high, but that he ought to be ſubject unto, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable by the meaneſt Civil Officer in a Kingdom, City, or Town, not only for common crimes, but even for the abuſe of their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Offices; yea, they hold, that they ought to be more puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable than any other Subject whatſoever, if they ſhall offend againſt either Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Laws.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Civil Magiſtrate is to puniſh with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity the Eccleſiaſtical Officers of Churches, if they ſhall intrude upon the rights and prerogatives of the Civil Authority, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and ſhall paſs thoſe bounds and limits that Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto them in his Word.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Pope is that Antichriſt, and therefore that Antichriſt, becauſe being but an Eccleſiaſtical Officer, he doth in

                     <p>
                        <hi>To uſe them is ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Propoſition cannot be denied, for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly condemneth Will-Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption may thus be proved:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All parts of Divine Service and Worſhip, impoſed only by the will and pleaſure of Man upon the Miniſters of Divine Service, and that of neceſſity to be done, is Will-Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to uſe theſe Ceremonies in manner and form preſcribed, is to uſe ſuch Ceremonies as are</hi> 1. <hi>Parts of Divine Service and Worſhip.</hi> 2. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only by the pleaſure and will of Men, upon the Miniſters of Divine Service. 3. Of neceſſity to be done therein.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To uſe theſe Ceremonies in manner and form preſcribed, is a Will-Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition is as clear as the Sun at noon-day.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption hath three parts:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they are parts of Divine Worſhip and Service.</p>
                     <p>This is proved evidently by this Argument:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All Mystical and Eccleſiaſtical Rites and formes of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, inſtituted by Eccleſiaſtical authority, to be Miniſterial actions in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119992:32"/> the ſolemn Worſhip of God, and performed in that manner, and having that uſe in Divine Service, that if God ſhould but ratifie and confirm the ſame uſe, they ſhould then be parts of his true Worſhip; (I ſay) all ſuch Ceremonies are uſed as parts of Divine Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But theſe Ceremonies in controverſie, are either all, or the greateſt part of them ſuch.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are parts of Divine Worſhip and Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition cannot with any modeſt face be denied; For elſe how could a ſole Divine ratification of the preſent uſe of them make them parts of his true Worſhip? If they were not uſed as parts of his Worſhip before.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is as manifeſt: For if Chriſt ſhould by ſome Revelation from heaven ſignifie, That it is his will that a Miniſter in Divine Service ſhould wear a white linnen garment, in Baptiſm make the ſign of a Croſs, to theſe ends and purpoſes that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Service Book, then certainly they ſhould be eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts of his Divine Worſhip, elſe the Jewiſh Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and our Sacraments are no parts thereof.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of the Aſſumption of the firſt Syllogiſm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That they are impoſed only upon the pleaſure and will of man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is evident: For thoſe things that God leaves as indifferent to the will and diſcretion of man to do, or leave undone, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by man upon man, are impoſed only upon the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of man.</p>
                     <p>The third part of the Aſſumption is:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That they are of neceſſity to be done in Divine Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which is alſo out of all doubt; For a Miniſter ſtands bound to do them upon pain of ſuſpenſion and deprivation: And God muſt have no ſolemn Worſhip in <hi>England,</hi> except it be adminiſtred in the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Upon all this it follows:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That to uſe theſe Ceremonies in manner and form preſcribed, is to uſe ſuch Ceremonies as are parts of Divine Worſhip, impoſed only by the will of Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>It is a ſin againſt God, for him that is by way of Excellency a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, (without a preciſe and direct warrant from him) at any time (especially in the Solemn Worſhip of God) to give ſpecial honour to Antichrist and his members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to uſe theſe Ceremonies, is in that manner aforeſaid, to give ſpecial honour to Antichriſt and his members.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a ſin against God to uſe them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Propoſition is manifeſt and clear to any that have an eye of Reaſon and any light of Divinity ſhining in it: For what is a ſin if this be not: That a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, even then when he is in the Service of Chriſt, ſhould perform ſpecial honour and ſervice to Antichriſt, or any of his Limbs.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is proved (if our Adverſaries will grant it, that the Pope is Antichriſt, and that all the viſible members of his Church, acknowledging him their ſupream head, are members of him) by this reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Such a Conformity to Antichriſt and his members in the Ceremonies of Religion and Form of Divine Worſhip, as is not only beſides the Word of God, but in a ſpecial manner derogatory to all reformed Churches that have departed from the Synagogue of</hi> Rome, <hi>is a ſpecial honour to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and his members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to uſe theſe Ceremonies in Divine Worſhip, is ſuch a Conformity to Antichriſt and his members.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To uſe theſe Ceremonies, in that manner aforeſaid, is to give ſpecial honour to Antichriſt and his Members.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition is without exception: For if it ſhould be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honour to the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> and their conformed Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for the Churches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> voluntarily to leave conformity to the Churches of the Low Countries, <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and to conform themſelves in Ceremonies and Form of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Prelatical Clergy of <hi>England:</hi> It muſt needs be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honour to Antichriſt and his Members, for any to do the like to them.</p>

                     <p>The Aſſumption is thus proved;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For a Minister of Jeſus Chriſt to conforme himſelf in ſuch peculiar Rites, Ceremonies and Formes of Divine Service, to Antichriſt and his members, as other reformed Churches have rejected for vain, fooliſh, and ſuperſtitious, is in a ſpecial manner derogatory to all other reformed Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to uſe theſe Ceremonies in controverſie, is in that manner to conforme himſelf.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is in a ſpecial manner derogatory to all other Reformed Churches.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>All Worſhip more than Civill, performed to any beſides God, is a ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To uſe theſe Ceremonies in manner and forme preſcribed, is to performe a more than civil honour (even a Religious) only to a humane Power and Authority;</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>To uſe theſe Ceremonies is to ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THe Propoſition needs no proof: For there is no middle Honor between Civil and Divine; and therefore that which is more than Civil, is Divine. Now Divine Honor is to be given only to God, who will not have his Glory given unto another.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is thus proved;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If theſe Ceremonies be Religious Ceremonies, and all Religious Ceremonies be a part of Divine worſhip, performed to that authority that inſtituteth and commandeth them.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition cannot be denyed of any reaſonable creature.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption hath three Parts:</p>
                     <p n="1">

                     </p>
                     <p>This needs no proof: For what ſhall we make to be Religious Ceremonies, if thoſe Ceremonies be not that are preſcribed by the Church, to the Church only, tied to Religion only, and Religious Functions, Offices, and Perſons; to be acted and performed only in Exerciſes of Religion and Divine Worſhip, and are myſtical ſhadowes and types of Religious Doctrine?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>That all Religious Ceremonies are parts of Divine Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This neither ſhould need any proof: If thoſe that are adverſaries unto us in this cauſe, did not too much preſume of the weakneſs of our Diſcourſe, and the ſtrength of their own wit. For there being an external Divine Worſhip, which properly conſiſts in the outward Rites and Ceremonies of Religion: What Ceremonies can be called parts thereof, if ſuch Religious Ceremonies as theſe be not? For if bowing the knee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Divine Worſhip, (though it be uſed alſo in Civil Worſhip) be a part of Divine Worſhip, much more are thoſe Ceremonies that are peculiarly appropriated to Divine Service and Worſhip, and wherein part of the forme thereof is made to conſiſt. But it may (for further ſatisfying of men) be thus proved:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All meer and immediate Actions of Religion are parts of Divine Worſhip.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Further, How can a man imagine that a meer Religious Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Act, done by a Servant of God in the ſolemn Service and Worſhip of God, by preciſe Canon of the Church, ſhould be no part of Divine Worſhip, ſith all the ſolemn Rites and Ceremonies that are uſed in the ſolemn Services of Civil States, (eſpecially ſuch as are done in their preſence) have been ever reputed parts of civil Honor and Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Conſidering that God in his Divine Worſhip doth require the whole heart, and all the powers of the Soul during the act of his Worſhip, It were great preſumption for any mortal Creature to preſcribe any Action to man during the ſame Act that is no part thereof: conſidering that every Action ſo preſcribed muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity pull a part of the heart from Divine Worſhip.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is moſt certain, for if they were inſtituted by Divine authority, they could not be eſteemed matters indifferent; and ſhould not be in the power and diſcretion of the Magiſtrate to diſanull them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition cannot be denied; for if we be branded with the cole of ſchiſme juſtly, for denying conformity in ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but to ſome of our own particular Churches wherein we live, though we be content to join with them that uſe them in Divine Worſhip: much more Schiſmaticks are they that are not conformable in Rites and Ceremonies, to the Catholick Church wherein they live.</p>
                     <p>I prove the Aſſumption:</p>

                        <hi>They are unlawful to be uſed in Divine Worſhip.</hi>

                     <p>THE Propoſition I think cannot be denied, when it is, I hope it may be proved.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part of the Aſſumption is clear: For if they were in themſelves lawful to be uſed, then might a Miniſter of the Goſpel, being left to his own diſcretion by the Magiſtrate, invent, inſtitute, and uſe the like Ceremonies in the ſame manner without ſin. For any man, left to himſelf, may lawfully do that which of it ſelf is lawful and indifferent. But a Miniſter ſhould ſin againſt God, if he ſhould of his own head inſtitute and uſe the like Ceremonies to theſe, though permitted by the Magiſtrate; except we ſhould hold, that it is lawful for a Miniſter to do any indifferent thing in Gods Service, for a man may of any indifferent thing make a Ceremony like unto one of theſe.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond part of the Aſſumption is thus proved:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If they be therefore lawful, becauſe, being thing in their own nature ifferent, the Magiſtrate commands them to be done in Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Then whatſoever thing (being in its own nature indifferent) is, or ſhall be commanded by the Magiſtrate, is lawful to be done in Divine Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But all things that are in themſelves matters indifferent, are not lawful to be done in Divine Service, though the Magiſtrate ſhould command them.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are not therefore lawful to be uſed in Divine S rvice, becauſe the Magiſtrate commands them, though they be things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition cannot be denied: For if ſome things, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their own nature, being commanded by the Magiſtrate, are unlawful, it can be no good Argument to ſay, Theſe things, being indifferent, are commanded by the Magiſtrate. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They may lawfully be done. Much leſs therefore they ought to be done. Or as the Doctors of <hi>Oxf.</hi> affirm, that they bind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is more clear than the Propoſition. If it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered either what things are indifferent indeed, or go under the name and title of indifferent things. Eating and drinking, the avoiding the ſuperfluities of Nature; due benevolence between Man and Wife; ſpinning and carding; killing of Oxen and Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which of themſelves have in them neither vertue nor vice, are therefore indifferent Actions; and yet I think none, except pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Atheiſts, but will hold it a foul ſin to do ſome of theſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any Aſſembly, much more in the ſolemn Worſhip of God, though the Magiſtrate ſhould command the ſame even upon pain of death. But if it be further conſidered, That Carding and Dicing, Masking and Dancing; for Men to put on Womens apparel, and Women Mens; Drinking to healths; Ribald, Stage-plaies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are things indifferent to be done even upon the Lords own day: May a Miniſter of the Goſpel, upon the Magiſtrates commandment, do any of theſe in Divine Worſhip? And yet there is none of theſe but may have applied unto them, by the Wit of Man, a Myſtical and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119992:37"/> Religious ſence; and then by this Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Rule, They muſt needs be good and lawful Ceremonies: for his principal Argument to prove them lawfull at his laſt Convention of <hi>London</hi> Miniſters before him, was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are Ceremonies that teach good Doctrine,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are good Ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas the filthieſt actions and things that are may teach good Doctrine: The Holy Ghoſt reſembleth the ſoul polluted with ſin to a menſtrous cloth: A man fallen again into ſin, to a Sow wallowing in the mire: might therefore a filthie Sow, and ſuch unclean Clothes, be brought into the Church, to be viſible ſhadowes, and repreſentations of ſuch things? Nay, What may not by this means be brought into Gods Worſhip, and yet by this reaſon be defended to be a good Ceremony, if the Magiſtrates and Biſhops ſhould decree the ſame? A fools coat and a beggers, worne in Divine Service, may fitly teach this Doctrine, <hi>Not many Wiſe, Not many Noble:</hi> A Miniſter clothed in ſuch apparrel as thoſe that act the Devils part in a play may teach this, That by nature we are limbs of Sathan, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of Hell: Men might wear Womens apparel, and Women mens; The one to teach, That the Church is Chriſts Wife; The other to teach, that Women in Chriſt are equall to Men. Bear-baiting may teach us, How Chriſt was baited before the Tribunalls of the Phariſees, or the combate between the fleſh and the ſpirit. But the groſſeneſs of theſe Aſſertions will appear in our Special Reaſons againſt the Ceremonies in particular.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>THE Propoſition may not be gainſaid: For all ſpiritual power uſurped over the Churches of God, is an Antichriſtian autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and to profeſs ſpiritual homage thereunto, is to profeſs ſpritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al homage unto Antichriſt, which muſt needs be a ſin,</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption hath two parts:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That theſe Ceremonies are an acknowledging by ſolemn ſigns a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Homage to the ſpiritual authority of Archbiſhops and Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which is moſt evident; for it having been proved before, that they are meer Eccleſiaſtical, Religious and ſpiritual Actions, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an Eccleſiaſtical and ſpiritual authority, They muſt needs be Signs of ſpiritual homage to the ſame authority. For either the doing of a Religious and ſpiritual Action, in obedience to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual authority, is a Sign of ſpiritual homage, or no Actions can be a Sign thereof. As therefore a Serving man, being a civil perſon, upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119992:38"/> the Biſhops pleaſure, wearing a Tawny Coat, and a Chain of Gold, holding up his Train, going bare-headed before him, holding a Trencher at his Table, lighting him to the houſe of Office, dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his meat, rubbing his Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth by theſe Actions, as it were by ſolemn Signs, acknowledge Civil homage to him, being a Civil Lord and Maſter: So a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and a Paſtor of a particular Congregation, being by his Office a meer ſpiritual man; being commanded by the Biſhop, as he is a ſpiritual Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter over the Church of God, to wear a Tipper, a ſquare Cap, a Prieſts Gown and Cloak, a Surplice; to make Croſſes upon childrens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to put Rings on Brides fingers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service: I ſay, a Miniſter doth thereby give ſolemn Signs and Tokens of ſpiritual homage to their ſpiritual Lordſhips; even as by preaching the Word and adminiſtration of Sacraments and Prayer, he profeſſeth by ſolemn Signs a ſpiritual homage to the ſpiritual authority of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>If they ſhall peremptorily affirm, That they are only Civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (as ſome in high place have done to my ſelf) then this will follow of it: Whereas the Biſhops command now Miniſters to wear a Surplice, a Prieſts Cloak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may command them to wear Tawny Coats, and livery Cloaks, and in their courſes to wait and at end upon him, as ſerving Creatures: For there is no more Civil Authority ſhewed in requiring the one than the other, if the one as well as the other be Civil matters. Neither will it help their cauſe, that the Magiſtrate requireth theſe things to be done: For the Magiſtrate commanding Eccleſiaſtical matters to be done, his commandment doth no more make them Civil, than his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacraments, and other parts of Divine Worſhip, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred duly, doth make them Civil matters. For the ratification by Civil authority the Conſtitutions of Eccleſiaſtical authority, doth no more make them Civil matters, than the ratification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Civil matters by Eccleſiaſtical authority doth make them Eccleſiaſtical or ſpiritual matters.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119992:39"/> Services: So, as though they were Lords and Maſters in the Church, they turn the Miniſters out of their Offices, and ſhut them out of the Church, if they refuſe to wear their ſpiritual Liveries, and to do them ſpiritual and religious Service. But I come to the ſecond part of the Aſſumption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That the authority of our Lord Archbiſhops and Biſhops, is an uſurped authority.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thoſe Officers and Rulers in the Church, that make claim to be of Divine Inſtitution, challenge to themſelves Apoſtolical authority and juriſdiction, as the only Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, to ſit only in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair; To have ſole power of the Keys; To cut from the viſible Church, and receive again; To have power of creating and displacing all other Eccleſiaſtical Officers; To be the Univerſal Paſtors of whole Dukedoms and Kingdoms, under whom all other Paſtors are as Curates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And yet for all this, are ſuch as ſtand and are ſupported only by humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Ceremonies, ſuch as a Civil Magiſtrate may, without ſin, put out of the Church; and ſuch as the true Churches of God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce (and yet continue the true Church) as Antichriſtian Uſurpers and ſpiritual Tyrants. (I ſay) all ſuch Officers and Rulers exerciſe a uſurped authority in the Church:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But our Archbiſhops and Biſhops are ſuch Rulers and Officers as are aforeſaid.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They execute a uſurped power over the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Propoſition may eaſily be juſtified: For if inferiour Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Paſtors of particular Congregations have had, and may have firm continuance in the Church without theſe humane deviſes and inventions; If the Magiſtrate cannot, without ſin, put them out of the Church; And if thoſe can be no true Churches that renounce to have particular Paſtors and Miniſters over them, it muſt much more hold in ſuch Church-Officers and Rulers as theſe are, if their authority be lawful and good: For whileſt the Apoſtles lived, they needed not any humane Traditions and devices to ſupport their authority; the Magiſtrates that ſought to put them down ſinned
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119992:39"/> with a high hand: And that was no Church that renounced and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed their Office, Authority, and Juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is as eaſily juſtified: For 1. They make claim and title to all thoſe Prerogatives before rehearſed in the firſt part of the Propoſition, and unto more than that, as ſhall be proved if it be denied. 2. It is an Embleme of their own, <hi>NO CERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONY, NO BISHOP.</hi> Ergo, <hi>No humane Tradition and Invention, no Biſhop. Ergo,</hi> The Office of a Biſhop is ſupported by them, either only or ſpecially. 3. Their Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is derived from the King, elſe it is a flat denial of his Supremacy. Alſo, themſelves grant in their laſt Tables of Diſcipline, That the King hath power to encreaſe or diminiſh the Circuit of a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick: That he may make two or more Biſhoppricks of one, and one Biſhopprick to be two or more: Yea, what ſhould hinder, but that he may devide the Biſhopprick of <hi>London</hi> into eight hundred. For, where God hath not defined the number of Pariſhes that a Biſhop is to raign over, it muſt needs be a thing indifferent: In which, by their own Doctrines, the King hath authority, without ſin, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If therefore the King may as well (notwithſtanding any thing in the Law of God) Give the Keys of the Church to every particular Paſtour of a Congregation, over his own Congregation, as to a Biſhop over a Dioceſs, which taketh away the very Eſſence of an Engliſh Biſhop; He may, without ſin, take away the very Office of the Biſhop, which conſiſts in having Juriſdiction over many Congregations. Alſo, it being not defined, by the Word of God, but left free, what attire Biſhops ſhall wear, as alſo, what main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they ſhall have; The King, having abſolute power in things indifferent, according to their own Doctrine, He may turn them out of their Rochets and Parliament Robes; Thruſt them out of their Pallaces, and put them to their ſtipends, to live upon voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of poor Chriſtian People, and then a man may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what the Office of a Biſhop would be worth: For, he that hath authority to preſcribe to a Biſhop, and other Miniſters, the Forms, Rites, and Ceremonies of their Divine Service, hath alſo power much more, to preſcribe, moderate, and appoint their Apparel, Diet, and manner of maintenance. So that it is clear, That the King may, without ſin, diſanul the Authorities, Dignities, and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Biſhops; Any of which ſhall be (if it be denied) proved to be matters of greater indifferency, and therefore more appertaining to his Supremacy, than the preſcribing of Forms of Divine Service,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119992:40"/> and myſtical Rites of Religion. For let the King take from the Biſhop all indifferent things (which he may do by their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) and a Biſhop will be no Biſhop, as ſhall be proved, if it be denied. 4. There is no true and ſober Chriſtians but will ſay, that the Churches of <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> the Low-Countries, and other places (that renounce ſuch Archbiſhops and Biſhops (as ours are) as Anticriſtian and uſurping Prelates) are true Churches of God: which they could not be, if the Authority and Prerogatives they claim to themſelves, were of Chriſt, and not uſurped. For if it were the Ordinance of Chriſt Jeſus, That in every Kingdome, that receiveth the Goſpel, There ſhould be one Archbiſhop over the whole Kingdome; One Biſhop over many hundred Paſtors, in a Kingdome, and all they inveſted with that authority and Juriſdiction Apoſtolicall which they claim <hi>jure Divino,</hi> to be due unto them, and to reſide in them, by the Ordinance of Chriſt; Certainly that Church that ſhould renounce and diſclaim ſuch an Authority, ordained in the Church, cannot be a true Church, but a Synagogue of Sathan. For they that ſhould renounce and deny ſuch, muſt needs therein renounce and deny Chriſt himſelf. Thus the Aſſumption is cleared.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>The Aſſumption hath two parts:</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That theſe Ceremonies are ſuch as may, without ſin, or any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to any part of the worſhip of God, be omitted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is evident: For 1. if they could not be omitted without ſin in Divine Worſhip, they were Divine and not Humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. For example, Though to go clothed to the Congregation be a Civil action, yet, becauſe it is a ſin, for any to go naked to the Congregation, It is a Divine Ordinance, That men ſhould go clothed thither. And in this caſe (as in any other caſe of ſin) a man ought rather never Worſhip God publickly, than to go naked to the Congregation. For the omiſſion of a Good Action is no ſin, when it cannot be done, but by committing of a ſin? 2. Divine Worſhip conſiſting in Prayer, the Sacraments, and the Word, no wit of man can ſhew wherein the bare omiſſion of any one of theſe Ceremonies is inconvenient to any one of theſe parts: for what inconvenience can a man (that is not drunk with the dreggs and lees of Popiſh Superſtition) finde it to publick Prayer, to be ſaid in the Congregation without a Prieſts Surplice? The omiſſion of ordinary pawſes and Accents, points and ſtopps, the ſuppreſſing of the voice, or a loud hooping and hallowing out of the words, or an undiſtinct ſounding of them, were ſuch actions as common reaſon will teach are inconvenient for Prayer, and ſo inconvenient, that a man ought never to pray publickly in the Congregation, as the voyce thereof, that ſhould by Canon be tied thereto: And the Magiſtrate (though there were no Canon to the contrary) ought to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119992:41"/> turn ſuch out of the Miniſtry that ſhould omit ſuch matters in prayer. But for a Miniſter to pray without a Surplice, can be in reaſon no more inconvenient, than for him to pray without Book, without a pair of ſpectacles upon his noſe. And there may be as good reaſon given to prove it convenient for a man that ſaith a thing without Book, to put on a pair of Spectacles, as there can be to prove it convenient for him that is to pray in the Church, to put upon himſelf a white linen Garment.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of the Aſſumption is this;</p>

                     <p>The Propoſition cannot be gainſayed. It being a Topick Axiom. <hi>Cujus privatio eſt deterior, illud ipſum eſt melius:</hi> to wit, The worſe the Privation of a thing is, the better the thing is. For Example, If blindneſs be worſe than deafneſſe; Then is the poſitive habit of ſeeing better than that of hearing. So, if Non-conformity be worſe than Drunkenneſſe, Blaſphemy, Idolatry, Filthineſs of Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It muſt needs follow, that Conformity is a more excellent thing in it ſelf than Sobriety; the true Worſhip of God, the glorifying of the name of God, than a chaſte and honeſt life: But all theſe are urged by the Word of God, as neceſſary means to Salvation: For the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>No Murderer, Adulterer, Unclean perſon, Idolater,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> If therefore Conformity be more urged by our Lawes than theſe, and the Privation more puniſhed: If this be more ſtrictly required of Chriſtians, yea, of principal Chriſtians, even the Miniſters of the Word, than the other, they muſt needs be urged more neceſſary to Salvation than the other. For, of the more excellency a Chriſtian vertue is, the more neceſſary to Salvation it is.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption in every part and parcel thereof may be juſtified by the practice and Aſſertions of our Adverſaries, not only privately, but in publick: For the 1.

                        </gap>d or ſing the Kings Service, as they call it: And yet if Preaching were not neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Paul</hi> that was above an Archbiſhop, ſhould not have been under a woe, if he had not done it. For no Miniſter of the Goſpel is under a woe, that performeth all ſervices to the Churches of God that are neceſſary to Salvation. Neither was <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching a Reading of <hi>Homilies,</hi> or of a Service Book. For the 3. Nothing is more notorious then for us that make ſcruple of theſe things to be reputed worſe than Papiſts: One that is a great Judge in theſe cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, affirmed it unto my ſelf. Another, openly at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe, in mine own hearing, made no doubt but the Papiſts were in the Church, but he made great doubt whether the Puritanes were. And yet we are Puritanes for nothing elſe, but for refuſing Conformity
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119992:42"/> to their Ceremonies: For, howſoever they ſlander us with many other groſs imputations, yet they cannot lay any thing to our charge but our conſcience in this. For all other matters concerning their own Eſtates and Dignities, conſidering how deſperate they are, and unreformable, we can be content to leave them to the Judgment of God, who (as it ſeems) intendeth to glorifie himſelf by ſome other means, than by their Converſion. For the 4. Read <hi>Scottiſh, Genevat. The Survey, Remonſtrance,</hi> &amp;c. And ye ſhall finde all this laid to their Charge. Alſo their practice ſufficiently proveth it; for the Miniſters that are of late ſuſpended and deprived, only refuſing to uſe theſe Ceremonies, bear their condemnation under theſe Names and Titles.</p>
                     <p>The 5. and 6. is proved by their own late Canons; For, if they be to be excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as holding damnable and wicked Errours, that ſhall Profeſs any of theſe Ceremonies to be unlawfull, a man ought not to acknowledge himſelf a member of any ſuch Church, as doth affectedly caſt them out of Gods worſhip: For, for what Error a particular perſon is not to be reputed as a member of the Church, but as a Heathen and Publican; for the ſame a whole Church is not to be reputed a Church, but a <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The 7. may be juſtified by many Inſtances of many vile and impious perſons of thoſe kindes tolerated in the Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>The 8. is proved by him that anſwers the <hi>Plea of the Innocent,</hi> who ſaith, That they that call in queſtion the lawfulneſs of theſe Ceremonies, call in queſtion her late Majeſties Religion; which they could not do, except (at the leaſt) part of her Religion conſiſted in them.</p>
                     <p>Further, If this doth not ſufficiently prove the main Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, let theſe Reaſons following be wayed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Church be neceſſary to Salvation, and if the Pillars of the Church be neceſſary to the Church, and if the Lord Biſhops be the Pillars of the Church, and theſe or ſuch like Cermonies be the main Supporters of Lord Biſhops: then are theſe Ceremonies in the judgment of the Prelates neceſſary to Salvation. For no Church, no Salvation; no Pillar of the Church, no Church: No L. Biſhop, no Pillar of the Church: No Ceremony, no Lord Biſhop. <hi>Ergo, No</hi> Ceremony of this kinde, no Salvation.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:119992:42"/>2. All Divine Conſtitutions binding conſcience are neceſſary to Salvation: But by the late Doctrine of the Prelates and others, theſe Ceremonies (being not unlawfull) when they are commanded by the Church, are ſaid not to be humane but Divine Conſtitutions, binding conſcience; therefore they (as they are urged) are neceſſary to Salvation. For all divine Conſtitutions binding conſcience, are neceſſary to Salvation, or elſe, nothing on our part can be ſaid in any ſence to be neceſſary thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary to Salvation, that men ſhould not only worſhip God, but worſhip him in a comely, decent, and orderly manner, it being a matter of damnation to worſhip God in a confuſed, unſeemly, and diſordered manner, but by the Doctrine of our Prelates, comelineſs, decency, and order, conſiſts in the uſe of theſe Ceremonies; <hi>Ergo,</hi> in their Judgment they are neceſſary to Salvation.</p>

                        <hi>All actions, not required by the Word of God, (though commanded by humane authority) that are apparent means of the Damnation of the Souls of infinite numbers of men, are directly againſt the Law of charity, and therefore ſin.</hi>

                     <p>THE Propoſition is without queſtion: For if, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from God, I may, upon the ſole will and pleaſure of the Magiſtrate, or Governours of the Church, do that by which I ſhall be a means of the damnation of my brothers ſoul, which is the greateſt breach of the law of charity that can be: Then may I do any ſin at their commandment without ſin, for what greater ſin can there be againſt the ſecond Table than this, to be a witting Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Neighbours damnation. Which though it be but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jeſt to our great Doctors, that have many Cures, and no care of ſouls, yet, to them which know the price of a ſoul, it is more than if, upon the meer will of the Magiſtrates, they ſhould be forced to kill their own Children and deareſt Beloveds with their own hand.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>The Magiſtrate having authority given him by God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things Indifferent, he commanding, they are to be done, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Scandal of our Neighbour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though the Subject ought to obey his Magiſtrate in all Indifferent actions impoſed upon him whatſoever, yet I deſire that it may be proved, that God in his Word hath given to any Power or Potentate upon Earth any ſuch abſolute authority. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is Gods Lieutenant, and the glory of the Magiſtrate conſiſts in this, In that, under God, he beareth a Sword, to puniſh thoſe that tranſgreſs his Laws, but he is by Gods Ordinance to be the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and protector of the Chriſtian Liberty of his Subjects. That therefore he hath power granted him of God (upon his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) to take away the ſame, eſpecially in ſuch a caſe, requires proof out of the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If he have ſuch a power, yet thoſe things that God leaves to his will to command, or not to command, he cannot command
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119992:43"/> under a greater penalty than bodily death; for his Sword can cut no deeper, and then in the caſe of Scandal a Chriſtian Subject ought rather to ſuffer the Magiſtrate to take away his life, than to do that which ſhall procure the Damnation of his Brothers Soul. And in thus doing, he is no contemner of the Magiſtrates Law, but a fulfiller of the Law of Charity, in not deſtroying his brothers Soul upon the meer pleaſure of a mortal man.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But the commandment of the Magiſtrate takes away the ſcandal, when the thing is done in obedience to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is another deſperate ſhift. As though the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the weak brother that judgeth a thing indifferent to be a Sin will be ever the more ſatisfied and relieved in the matter by the authority of the Magiſtrate, nothing but the authority of God either can or ought to ſatisfie a doubting conſcience. And as for them that put ſuperſtition in things indifferent, and are that way ſcandalized, the authority of the Magiſtrate or Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, their ſcandal is encreaſed, and not removed by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But we muſt more reſpect Obedience to the Magiſtrate, than the ſcandal of inferiour perſons, the thing commanded being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not evil.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The thing commanded is not indifferent, then when it is a ſcandal and ſtumbling block to our brother. 2. We muſt obey the Magiſtrate only in the Lord, but this is not to obey him in the Lord, only upon his pleaſure to deſtroy a ſoul for whom Chriſt died. 3. An obedience to the Magiſtrate, ſo far as to the condemnation of our brothers ſoul, muſt be a ſpecial obedience, in ſome ſpecial good and juſt commandment, which cannot be verified of a commandment that requireth only a thing indifferent, much leſs ſuch an indifferent, as is a ſcandal and means of deſtruction to mens ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such a forbearing of obedience only in love to the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our brothers ſoul, being without apparent contempt of the Magiſtrate, and having adjoyned with it a meek ſubmiſſion to the mercy of the Magiſtrate, cannot be called a diſobedience, but is indeed a better obedience than theirs, that do contrary, who in their obedience bring the bloud of the ſouls they deſtroy, both upon their own heads, and the Magiſtrate, which is a ſin in the eyes of God worſe than rebellion.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. He that preacheth cannot aſſure himſelf of the ſalvation of one ſoul by the ſame, for that is wrought by the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. And he hath little cauſe to hope for a bleſſing upon that preaching which he purchaſeth with the price of bloud, yea, of the bloud of ſouls.</p>

For his Majeſty, we doubt not but (if the Prelates would) he would eaſily yield to the removal of them, and therefore he cannot be ſcandalized at the refuſal, when it is of meer conſcience, though of conſcience deceived. 2. The States and Inferiour Magiſtrates of the Kingdom have in all Parliaments ſhewed themſelves willing, and ready to ſet their hands to the removal of them. 3. If the King and State will be ſcandalized, becauſe upon their meer will and pleaſure, I will not do that which I am perſwaded will be a means of the deſtruction of their ſouls for whom Chriſt died: They will be much more ſcandalized at me if I do it; For ſuch an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as this, muſt needs be a means of begetting or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange ſins in their ſouls: for as it is a kind of deifying of themſelves, To require (even in the caſe of ſcandal) a thing indifferent to be done; ſo they that ſhall in ſuch a caſe obey, cannot but nouriſh exceedingly that corruption from which ſuch a commandment ſhall proceed. 4. The ſoul of the meaneſt and pooreſt in a Kingdom coſt as great a price, and is as dear to Chriſt, as the ſoul of the Nobleſt, and in the matter of ſcandal, as great heed is to be taken to them, as to any other: And it ſhews of what ſpirit theſe men are of, that think they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſouls of Chriſts little ones, rather than diſpleaſe a mortal man.</p>

Such things that (but for the Commanders pleaſure) makes no matter whether they be done or no. Which are indeed unworthy to be commanded of Worthies. 2. A pretended ſcandal in humour is eaſily diſcerned by thoſe that are wiſe and not malicious, for they that are ready to performe all obedience to the Magiſtrate in all other heavier and greater things, are ready in his Service to ſpend their goods and lives, that think nothing too dear for the redeeming of his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that are in all other things as obedient, and more obedient than any other of his ſubjects: It is not to be ſuppoſed of any, (that are not poſſeſt with the malicious ſpirit of Antichriſt) that ſuch ſhould refuſe to obey the Kings pleaſure in a toye, and a trifle, (ſuch as are all things indifferent) except that in obeying him they were perſwaded that they ſhould ſin againſt their own conſcience, which, next unto God, they have cauſe to pleaſe, far above all the Kings of the earth, for it hath greater power to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them than they have.</p>

                        <hi>All apparent means of confirming men in Schiſm, Superſtition, and Idolatry, by means whereof many have profeſſedly lived and died therein without repentance, are apparent means of the damnation and deſtruction of many ſouls amongſt us: But</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe Ceremonies are ſuch.</hi> Ergo,</p>
                     <p>The Propoſition cannot be denied, for what action of man can be ſaid to be a means of the damnation and deſtruction of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſoul, if theſe actions be not, that confirm men in ſuch foul ſins? So that either a man can do nothing that ſhall deſtroy his brothers ſoul (which is directly againſt the expreſs words of S. <hi>Paul</hi>) Or elſe ſuch a conformity, in ſuch actions as confirm men in ſuch damnable ſins, doth deſtroy his ſoul.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119992:45"/>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is as evident as any ſuch matter can be. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Papiſts, not only amongſt us, (which are innumerable) but others alſo do profeſs, that by our uſe of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (which are conſecrated myſteries of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) they are confirmed in the truth of their Religion, and the falſhood of ours. And good reaſon they have ſo to judge: For if the broth be good that the Devil is ſod in, ſure the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf muſt needs be good alſo. 2. Thoſe Chriſtians of the Seperation, that are called <hi>Browniſts,</hi> being many hundreds, profeſſing the ſame faith that we do, are by the retaining of Reliques, confirmed in their Schiſm, and Seperation from us; And live and die in this opinion, <hi>That our Churches are no true Churches,</hi> and <hi>that a man cannot, without ſin, communicate with them.</hi> And the main ground of this is, for that we mingle with Divine worſhip theſe baſe and vile inventions of men, Yea, of the accurſed Antichriſt. What? Is a linnen rag, and a Chriſts Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be reputed of ſo great value and price, that the fellowſhip and ſpiritual communion of ſo many Chriſtians, (as ſound in religion as any Prelate in the Realm) ſhould be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rejected for them?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Common experience teacheth us, that there are infinite numbers in this Realm ignorant and ſuperſtitious folk, that place as much, or more holineſs in theſe things, than in the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God; And how can it be otherwiſe, when they ſhall ſee the Rulers of the Church, mingle Heaven, Earth, and Hell together in this manner about them. Curſing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematizing all that ſhall not embrace them. How can they but imagine, that the ſight of a Surplice upon a Prieſts back ſhall bring them to heaven, when they ſhall ſee thoſe that keep Heaven Keys, ſend a man, for want of ſuch a wedding garment, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> to hell?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If it be but conſidered, that all other Proteſtant Churches have rejected them as menſtruous cloaths, that more than the greateſt number of Paſtors in our own Land, that deſires the name of faithful and painful Teachers, either count them impious, or at leaſt the burdens or reproaches of our Churches: that the firſt appointers of them, (after our ſeperation from <hi>Rome</hi>) intended only a toleration of them, that the moſt ſcandalous and leud perſons in our Congregations, are the hotteſt for them, that every Parliament ſince her Majeſties raign
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119992:45"/> hath been forward in the removing of them, that the defence of them hath driven men to run into the broching of many groſſe and Popiſh errours. And that ſo many Miniſters, (a catalogue of whoſe names and ſtates, I could wiſh were publiſhed to all poſterity, that it may ſee the wonderfull milde and moderate government of Prelates) have endured and expected daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the grateſt extremities for the ſame: I ſay, if theſe things be duly conſidered, a man ſhall eaſily ſee, that theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are ſtumbling blocks, layd by the Devill and his Agents in the wayes of all the people of this Realm, to hinder the progreſs of the Goſpel, and to make all men ſtumble in the wayes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                     <p>The Propoſition is evident, for all outward Idolatry is Divine worſhip; and nothing but outward Idolatry is <hi>directly</hi> forbidden in the 2d. Commandement.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond part of the Aſſumption is thus proved,</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The propoſition we prove thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Either all ſuch devices and inventions are contrary unto the</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>

                        <hi>Commandement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption or latter part of this Syllogiſme cannot be denyed of any, but ſuch as ſhall deſperately ſet themſelves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of God. For if there were no figure or Trope in the commandement, then to bow down unto, and to worſhip the Sun, Moon and Stars, or any other of Gods creatures, yea,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119992:46"/> or any image made by any other, ſhould be no breach of this commandement, much leſs to offer Jewiſh Sacrifices of ſheep and Oxen, to circumciſe, to go a pilgrimage to Saints, to kiſſe the Paxe, to ſprinkle with holy water, to baptize Bells, or to uſe any other Popiſh rites; in which if a man ſin not againſt the ſecond commandement, he ſinneth not againſt any.</p>
                     <p>Again, It would be demanded, againſt what commandement, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> ſinned, when they offered ſtrange fire. The Iſraelites, when they abuſed <hi>Gideons</hi> Ephod, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.27. The Corinthians in eating meat offered to Idols, in the Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Either they ſinned not againſt this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by conſequent againſt none, or elſe there muſt needs be a wonderfull large Trope in the ſame, which I think never any Divine, Jew or Chriſtian, Proteſtant or Papiſt ever denyed before now.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition is as evident if it be conſidered, that in the 2<hi rend="sup">.d</hi> commandement, literally and in propriety of ſpeech, nothing is forbidden, but the making of Images for worſhip, and the bowing down unto them &amp; worſhiping of them: Now if there be a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche in the commandement, there muſt of neceſſity be not onely other kinds of falſe outward worſhip of Idolatry, different in form from making and bowing down unto Images and Idols, but there muſt be alſo ſome common cauſe or ground, upon which making and bowing unto Images is forbidden, which muſt be the third Argument, and reaſon by which all other kinds of falſe outward worſhip are brought under bowing unto images, &amp; condemne in that, elſe it were ſenſeleſs to make any thing that is not a bowing down unto Images to be condemned under that name and title. For when one thing is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned under another, it is becauſe that thing doth communicate with it in the ſame cauſe for which it is condemned. For example; if under, bowing down unto Images, Jewiſh Circumciſion, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are forbidden, foraſmuch as theſe cannot in any ſenſe be called <hi>Bowing down to Images;</hi> there muſt be ſome cauſe why bowing down into Images is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, which muſt ſtretch it ſelfe unto them, and bring them under it, which muſt be as it were a common <hi>genus</hi> unto it and them.</p>
                     <p>Now let all the wits in the world lay their heads together, and they ſhall never be able to deviſe any ſuch common <hi>genus,</hi> that ſhall be the common cauſe why not onely <hi>bowing down to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:119992:46"/> but why, under it all other kind of Idolatry and falſe worſhip is condemned, but this, for that they were <hi>humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, &amp; inventions,</hi> and therefore under the moſt uſual and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall received invention of man, God condemneth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Inventions</hi> uſed to the ſame end. If this be not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then there are and may be infinite, outward Idolatries and Superſtitions that cannot with any reaſon be referred to this commandement. Therefore it muſt needs follow that either there is no trope in the commandement, or that all ſuch inventions of man are forbidden in the ſame.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>A PROTESTATION</hi> of the Kings Supremacy.</head>
                  <p>WE <hi>hold and maintain,</hi> the ſame Authority and Supremacy in all cauſes and over all perſons Civil and Eccleſiaſticall, granted by Statute to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and expreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the book of Advertiſements and Injunctions, and in Mr. <hi>Bilſon</hi> againſt the Jeſuites, to be due in full and ample mannner (without any limitation or qualification) to the King and his Heirs and Succeſſours for ever. Neither is their (to our knowledge, any one of us, but is and ever hath been moſt willing to <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> and <hi>ſwear</hi> unto the ſame, according to form of Statute, And we deſire that thoſe that ſhall refuſe the ſame may bear their own iniquity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are ſo far from judging the ſaid Supremacy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: that we are perſwaded that the King ſhould ſin highly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, if he ſhould not aſſume the ſame unto himſelf, and that the Churches within his Dominions ſhould ſin damnably, if they ſhould deny to yield the ſame unto him, yea though the Statutes of the Kingdom ſhould deny it unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We hold it plain Antichriſtianiſm for any Church, or Church Officers whatſoever, either to arrogate or aſſume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any part or parcel thereof, &amp; utterly unlawful for the King to give away or alienate the ſame from his own Crown and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to any ſpiritual potentates or rulers whatſoever within or without his dominions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We hold that though the Kings of this Realm were no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church but very Infidels, yea &amp; perſecutors of the truth that yet thoſe Churches that ſhall be gathered together within theſe Dominions ought to acknowledge and yeild the ſaid ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy unto them. And that the ſame is not tyed to their faith and Chriſtianity but to their very Crown from which no ſubject or ſubjects have power to ſeparate or disjoyne it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We hold that neither King nor civil eſtate are bound in matter of Religion to be ſubject and obedient to any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſon or perſons whatſoever, no further then they ſhall be able to convince their conſciences of the truth thereof out of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119992:49"/> Word of God. Yea we think they ſhould ſin againſt God, if they ſhould ground their Religion, or any part or parcel thereof upon the bare Teſtimony or Judgment of any man, or of all the men in the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We hold that no Churches or Church-Officers have power for any crime whatſoever to deprive the King of the leaſt of his Royal Prerogatives whatſoeer, much leſs to deprive him of his Supremacy wherein the Height of his Royal Dignity conſiſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We hold that in all things concerning this life whatſoever, the Civil Juriſdiction of Kings and Civill States excelleth and ought to have preheminence over the Eccleſiaſticall, and that the Eccleſiaſticall neither hath, nor ought to have any power in the leaſt degree over the bodies, lives, goods, or liberty of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, much leſſe of the Kings and Rulers of the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We hold that Kings by virtue of their ſupremacy have power: yea alſo that they ſtand bound by the Law of God to make Laws Eccleſiaſtical ſuch as ſhall tend to the good order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches in their Dominions; And that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ought not to be diſobedient to any of their Lawes, ſo far as in obedience unto them, they do not that which is contrary to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We hold that though the King ſhall command any thing contrary to the Word unto the Churches, that yet they ought not to reſiſt him therein, but onely peaceably to forbear O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and ſue unto him for grace and mercy, and where that cannot be obtained, meekely to ſubmit themſelves to the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We hold that the King hath power by virtue of his ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, to remove out of the Churches, whatſoever he ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to be practiſed therein, not agreeable to the Word of God. And if he ſhall ſee any defect either in the Worſhip of God, or in the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, he ought by his royal Authority and power to procure and force the redreſs thereof, yea, though it be without the conſent and againſt the will of the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verners themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. We <hi>hold</hi> that the King hath as much Authority over the Body, Goods, and Affaires, of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, as of any other of his Subjects whatſoever. And that by his Authority, he may force them not onely to all civil duties belonging unto them,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119992:49"/> but alſo unto Eccleſiaſtical: afflicting as great puniſhment upon them for the neglect thereof, as upon any other of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. We <hi>hold</hi> that he hath power, to remove out of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, all Scandalous Schiſmatical and Heretical Teachers, and by all due ſeverity of Lawes to repreſs them.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. We hold that all Eccleſiaſtical Lawes made by the King (not repugnant to the Word of God) do in ſome ſort bind the conſciences of his Subjects: and that no ſubject ought to refuſe obedience to any ſuch Law.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. We hold that the King onely hath power within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, to convene Synods or general Aſſemblies of Miniſters, and by his Authority Royal, to ratifie and give life and ſtrength, to their Canons and Conſtitutions, without whoſe ratification, no man can force any ſubject to yeild any Obedience unto the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. We hold that though the King may force the Churches to be ſubject and obedient unto him: and to be Members of the Common-wealth; yet that the Churches ſeverally or joyntly, have no power to force him: or any Subject, againſt their will to any ſervice unto them, or to any religions duty whatſoever. No, nor to be ſo much as a Member of any Church.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. We hold that the King ought not to be ſubject to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſures of any Churches, Church Officers or Synods whatſoever, but onely to that Church and thoſe Officers of his own Court and Houſhold, unto whom (in reverence of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and of the ſpiritual Graces of God he ſees ſhining in them) he ſhall of his own free will, ſubject and commit the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Soul, in whom there can be no ſuſpition nor fear of any partiality, or unjuſt or rigorous dealing againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. We hold that if any Eccleſiaſtical Governours (call them by what name you will) ſhall abuſe their Eccleſiaſtical Authority in the execution of their cenſures, upon any man whoſoever; That the King and Civil States under him, have power to puniſh them ſeverely for it, much more if they ſhall abuſe it upon the Supream Majeſty himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. If the King ſubjecting himſelf to ſpiritual Guides and Governours, ſhall afterwards refuſe to be guided and governed by them according to the Word of God, and living in notorious ſin without Repentance ſhall wilfully contemn and deſpiſe all their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119992:50"/> holy and religious Cenſures, that then theſe Governours are to refuſe to adminiſter the <hi>holy things</hi> of God unto him, and to leave him to himſelf and to the ſecret Judgement of God, &amp; wholly to reſign and give over that ſpiritual charge and tuition over him, which by calling from God and the King they did undertake. And more then this they may not do. And after all this, We hold that he yet ſtill retaineth, and ought to retain, intirely and ſolidly, all that aforeſaid ſupream power and Authority over the Churches of this Dominion, in as ample a manner, as if he were the moſt Chriſtian Prince in the World.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>We</hi> acknowledge King <hi>JAMES</hi> to be our onely lawful Sovereign, and unto him to be due all the aforeſaid <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> and we renounce and abjure all Opinions, Doctrines, Practiſes, whatſoever repugnant or contrary to the ſame, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtical and Antichriſtian, and wiſh they may be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. We never refuſed Obedience to any Lawes or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the King, or State whatſoever, but onely to ſuch as we have proved or are ready to prove, (if we might be heard with indifferency) to be contrary to the Word of God. And we are ready to take our Solemn Oathes, before the Throne of Juſtice, that the onely cauſe of our refuſal of Obedience to thoſe Canons of the Prelates for which we are at preſent ſo extreamly afflicted, is meere Conſcience, and a fear to ſin againſt God: And that if by due form of reaſoning we may be convinced in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the contrary, we are as willing as any Subjects in the Realm to Obey and Conform.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. We refuſe Obedience onely to ſuch Canons as require the performance of ſuch Acts, and Rites of Religion, as are rejected and abandoned of all other Reformed Churches, as Superſtitious Diſorders, Such, as are ſpecial Myſteries of the Romiſh Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Idolatry, Such as have been controverted in the Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince the laſt breaking forth of the Light of the Goſpel out of the cloud of Popery in <hi>Luthers</hi> time. Such as all Proteſtant Writers and Defenders of our Faith beyond the Seas, and moſt of our own Country men have either in general or particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as vain, idle, and unprofitable, Such as all the Faithful, and Painful Paſtors of this Realm, and in a manner all States and degrees of the ſame, would be content were removed, and ſwept out of the Church, and for which few or none are zealous but the Prelates, and their Adherents.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:119992:50"/>22. We deny no Authority to the King, in matters Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, but onely that which Chriſt Jeſus the onely Head of the Church hath directly, and preciſely appropriated unto himſelf, and hath denyed to communicate to any other creature or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the World. For we hold, That Chriſt alone is the Doctor of the Church in matters of Religon, and that the Word of Chriſt which he hath given unto his Church, is of abſolute perfection, containing in it all parts of the true Religion, both for Subſtance and Ceremony, and a perfect direction in all Eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whatſoever. Unto and from which it is not lawful for any Man or Angel, to add or detract.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. We are ſo far from making claim of any ſupremacy unto our ſelves (and thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Officers which we deſire) that we exclude from our ſelves and them (as that of which we are utterly uncapable) all Princely and Lordly ſtate, pompe and power whatſoever, holding it a ſin for any whoſoever to exerciſe (no not by commiſſion from the Magiſtrate) any Authority over the Body, Goods, Lives, Liberty of any Man whoſoever for any crime or offence whatſoever. So that any one of the baſeſt and moſt inferiour civil officers in a Kingdom hath and ought to have (in our Judgement) more Authority and Power over men then any or all the Eccleſiaſtical Officers in the ſame Kingdom or in the whole World. Yea we hold that the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Officer in the Church ought to be as ſubject unto the baſeſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil officers in the Kingdom, as the meaneſt Subject in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; And that they ought not by virtue of their office, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any freedom or immunity at all from any Civil Subjection whatſoever, belonging to any common Subject.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>We</hi> confine and bound all Eccleſiaſtical power within the limits onely of one particular Congregation, holding that the greateſt Eccleſiaſtical power ought not to ſtretch beyond the ſame; And that it is an arrogating of Princely Supremacy, for any Eccleſiaſtical perſon, or Perſons whoſoever, to take upon themſelves Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction over many Churches, much more over whole Kingdomes and Provinces of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. We <hi>hold</hi> it utterly unlawful for any one Miniſter to take upon himſelf, or accept of a ſole Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction over ſo much as one Congregation. And therefore we hold that ſome of the ſufficienteſt and moſt honeſt and godly men in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be choſen by the Heads of Families, to be adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119992:51"/> in Commiſſion as aſſiſtants to the Miniſter, in the ſpiritual Regiment of the ſouls of that Congregation, of which he is the paſtor.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. We <hi>hold</hi> that theſe Eccleſiaſtical Officers being ſo choſen by the Church or Congregation are to exerciſe over the ſaid Congregation only a Spiritual Iuriſdiction and power, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a carefull overſight of the outward behaviour of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Church, That it be not ſcandalous, offenſive, and unbeſeeming Chriſtians, And if any Member ſhall be delinquent they are brotherly to admoniſh him, ſhewing him the nature of his crime by the word of God, And if after two or three admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, he ſhew no tokens of ſorrow and penitencie, then are they to deny unto him the pledges and ſeales of the Church, to wit the Sacraments. If this cannot humble him but that he continue obſtinate in that ſin, then they are by the mouth of the Miniſter in Congregation (the whole Church conſenting freely thereto) denounce him to be no Member of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and ſo forbear to have any further charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, untill God ſhall work the grace of Repentance, in him: in this manner they are to proceed againſt all apparent and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident crimes only, as Murder, Adultery, Theft, Blaſphemie, Ribal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dery, Lying, Slandering, Profanation of the Sabothes, contempt of Divine Worſhip, Diſobedience to the Civil Magiſtrate, &amp;c. Neither ought the extreameſt of the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures any whit hinder the courſe of juſtice that the Civil Magiſtrate is to exerciſe againſt the ſame crimes; for if a Traytor himſelf ſhould be penitent, the Church ought to forgive him and lovingly to imbrace him as a Son, but the Magiſtrate ought to execute him, if he ſhould be obſtinate in that crime: As the Magiſtrate ought to cut him off from the Civil Communion of men, ſo ought the Congregation (of which he is a Member) cut him off from all ſpiritual Communion with them. If any one of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Officers themſelves ſhall ſin, he is ſubject to the cenſures of the reſt as any other member of the congregation. If they ſhall all ſin ſcandalouſly either in the execution of their Office or in any other ordinarie manner: Then the Congregation that choſe them freely, hath as free power to depoſe them, and to place others in their room. If the Congregation ſhall erre, either in chooſing or depoſing of her ſpiritual Officers. Then hath the Civil Magiſtrate alone power and authority to puniſh
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119992:51"/> them for their fault, co compel them to make better choiſe, or to defend againſt them thoſe Officers that without juſt cauſes they ſhall depoſe or deprive.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. We hold that thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Perſons that make claim to greater power and authority then this, Eſpecially they that make claim <hi>Iure Divino</hi> of power and Iuriſdiction to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with other Churches then that one Congregation of which they are or ought to be members, Do uſurp upon the Supremacy of the Civil Magiſtrate, who alone hath and ought to have (as we hold and maintain) a power over the ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in his Dominions, and who alone ought by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity not only to preſcribe common Laws and Canons of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and conſent, in Religion and worſhip of God unto them all; But alſo to puniſh the offences of the ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they ſhall commit againſt the laws of God, the policy of the Realm, and the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions enacted by his authority.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. We hold that the King ought not to give this authority away or to commit it to any Eccleſiaſtical Perſon or Perſons whatſoever, But ought himſelf to be as it were, Archbiſhop and general overſeer of all the Churches within his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ought to imploy under him, his honourable Counſel, his Iudges, Leiftenants, Iuſtices, Conſtables and ſuch like to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the Churches, in the ſeveral diviſions of their civil Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, viſiting them and puniſhing by their civil power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall ſee amiſs in any of them: Eſpecially in the Rulers and Governers.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. For as much as no people are more hated, perſecuted and wronged of the wicked world then the true Churches of Chriſt; We hold that no people in the Earth ſtand in more need of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate then they. And that it is the greateſt outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they can injoy in this life, to live under the Protection of their Swords &amp; Scepters, &amp; the greateſt cauſe of mourning when the ſame ſhall be bent againſt them. And we hold thoſe Churches to be no true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt that living in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhall refuſe ſubjection to the civil Regents and Governers of the ſame; be they (in reſpect of Religion) never ſuch Paganiſh Infidells.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. We hold it utterly unlawfull, for any Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whatſoever, by any armed force or power, againſt the will of the civil magiſtracy and State under which they live. To
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119992:52"/> erect and ſet up in publique, the true worſhip and ſervice of God or to beat down or ſuppreſs any ſuperſtition or Idolatry that ſhall be countenanced and maintained by the ſame. Only, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is to look to himſelf, that he communicate not with the evils of the times, induring what it ſhall pleaſe the State to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and ſeeking by all honeſt and peaceable means all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of publick abuſes, onely at the hands of civil publicke perſons, and all practiſes contrarie to theſe, we condemn as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and ſinfull.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. All that we crave of his Majeſtie and the State, is, that by his and their permiſſion and under their protection, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, it may be lawfull for us, to ſerve and worſhip God in all things according to his revealed will, and the manner of all other reformed Proteſtant Churches, that have made ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Rome,</hi> that we may not be forced againſt our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to ſtain and pollute the ſimple and ſyncere worſhip of God preſcribed in his word, with any humane Traditions and Rites whatſoever, but that in Divine worſhip we may be actors on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe things that may for matter or manner either inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or ſpecial be concluded out of the word of God. Alſo to this end that it may be lawfull for us to exhibite unto them and unto their Cenſure a true and ſyncere Confeſſion of our faith, containing the main Grounds of our Religion, unto which all other doctrines are to be conſonant: as alſo a Form of Divine worſhip and Eccleſiaſtical Government, in like manner warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word, and to be obſerved of us all under any civil pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that it ſhall pleaſe the ſaid Majeſtie, and ſtate to inflict, under whoſe authority alone, we deſire to exerciſe the ſame: and unto whoſe puniſhment alone we deſire to be ſubject if we ſhall offend againſt any of thoſe Lawes and Canons that themſelves ſhall approve in manner aforeſaid: and our deſire is, Not to worſhip God in dark corners, but in ſuch publick places and at ſuch convenient times as it ſhall pleaſe them to aſſigne, to the intent, that they and their officers may the better take notice of our offences (if any ſuch ſhall be committed in our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and aſſemblies) that they may puniſh the ſame accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And we deſire we may be ſubject to no other Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lords but unto Chriſt, nor unto any other Temporal Lords but unto themſelves, whom alone in this Earth we deſire to make our Judges and ſupreame Governers and Overſeers in all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119992:52"/> cauſes Eccleſiaſtical whatſoever, renouncing as Antichriſtian, all ſuch Eccleſiaſtical powers as arrogate and aſſume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under any pretence of the Law of God or man, the ſaid power which we acknowledge to be due only to the Civil Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. So long as it ſhall pleaſe the King and civil State (though to the great derogation of their own authority as we may have occaſion hereafter to prove) to maintain in this Kingdom, the State of the Hierarchy or Prelacie: We can (in Honour to his Majeſtie and the State, and in deſire of peace) be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envy to ſuffer them to injoy their ſtate and dignity, and to live as brethren, amongſt thoſe miniſters that ſhall acknowlege ſpiritual homage unto their ſpiritual Lordſhips, paying unto them all temporal duties, of tenths and ſuch like: yea and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in the ſervice and worſhip of God ſo far as we may do it without our own particular communicating with them in thoſe humane Traditions and rites, that in our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we judge to be unlawfull. Only we crave in all dutifull manner that which the very Law of Nature yeeldeth unto us, that for as much as they are moſt malicious enemies unto us and do apparently thirſt either after our blood, or ſhipwrack of our faith and conſciences, that they may not hence forth be our judges in theſe cauſes, but that we may both of us ſtand as parties at the bar of the Civil Magiſtrate to be tried in thoſe differences that are between us, and that when they ſhall pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly maligne or ſlander us or our cauſe, it may be lawfull for us in a dutifull, ſober, peaceable and modeſt manner without perſonal reproach or diſgrace, in as publick manner juſtifie our ſelves, and then inſteed of that ſillie mockſervice to the King of wearing a linnen rag upon our backs or making a Chriſtleſs Croſſe upon a Babies face, we ſhall be ready to perform and yeeld triple homage, ſervice, and tribute unto him, and ſhall think our lives and all that we have too vile to ſpend in the ſervice of him and the civil ſtate under him.</p>

                  <head>To my Chriſtian Friend, N. Grace and Peace.</head>
                  <p>HOwſoever it grieveth me to hear of, much more to ſee the troubles wherewith Sathan (knowing his time to be ſhort) doth trouble the Church of God in all places, about unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Popiſh Ceremonies, yet (to tell you the whole troth) my Grief is the leſſe, when I conſider that both they themſelves, who be moſt troubleſome, and do moſt urge thoſe Reliques of <hi>Rome,</hi> be ambitious, or Dumb Doggs, or Non-Reſident, ſerving their Bellies,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.17, 18 Phil. 3.2, 19. Gal. 6.12.</note> and minding Earthly Things, even like their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, who urged the Ceremonies of <hi>MOSES</hi> in the Primitive Churches, and their proceedings, (like themſelves) be ſo exorbitant that they cannot but prove odious to all men. What a matter is this, that after the Sacramental Bread is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, the Cup ſhould be denyed becauſe of not Kneeling? If any of theſe ſcrupulous Miniſters had played ſuch a part, though it were with one <hi>openly known to live in ſin, notorious without repentance, whom by the</hi> 26. <hi>Canon no Miniſter ſhall in any wiſe admit to the Receiving of the Holy Communion,</hi> how would that Preciſian be trounced. But in this Puritan Government of the Church there is no fault but <hi>Non Conformity</hi> to ſuperſtitious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; A Bird of their feather may Preach ſcores of Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, be ſcandalous in Life, and at his laſt caſt at Dice when he hath loſt all, ſay; <hi>In the Spite of God let him do now what he can,</hi> and yet hold his own well enough; An other Mans own and ill enough, I might well ſay if the Law might have due courſe: well, God amend all, and reſtrain the remnant of this Rage. In the mean while I rejoyce to hear that it is given to any of Gods people not onely to beleeve in Chriſt, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake, having the ſame fight which they ſee or hear to be in their Miniſters, as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whereof belongeth as well to the people as to the Miniſters of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.27.</note> For howſoever all are not to wear the Whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> Smock, yet all are to make conſcience of bowing the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119992:54"/> Knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> To confirm your zeal againſt the ſuperſtition of <hi>KNEELING,</hi> I have long ſought (being often ſollicited ſo to do by you) and at length found a ſhort but (in my poor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at leaſt to me) a ſufficient diſcourſe which I have printed, that I may comfort not onely you, but many others alſo who are in doubt, with that comfort wherewith I my ſelf am comforted of God. I ſay comforted. For when the judgement is ſatisfied the heart is comforted; This onely I require of you that there be no inquiring after or gueſſing at the Author or Publiſher. If that hurtful curioſity were mortified, learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now fearing that humour would be bolder to write and publiſh their Godly Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, touching points in controverſie; among other <hi>I</hi> hear of a more large and learned Treatiſe of this point, which no doubt the Author will publiſh in time, or other for him, if curious Heads, itching Ears, and wanton Tongues, do not hinder. In the mean while let us make as good uſe of this, as we can, And the Lord give us underſtanding in all things.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. KNEELING in the very Act of Taking, Eating and Drinking the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Bread and Wine, in the holy</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, cannot be without ſin.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is to be underſtood, that, howſoever Kneeling may (in it ſelf conſidered) be eſteemed a natural geſture of the body, as <hi>ſtanding, ſitting,</hi> &amp;c. yet in this caſe, it is by Inſtitution of Man. For neither nature nor cuſtom, doth teach us ordinarily to kneele when we eat and drink, neither doth the Word require <hi>Kneeling</hi> in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be by inſtitution, it muſt be either in reſpect of a more reverent receiving, or not. But if the moſt ſolemn ſign of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (uſed in theſe parts of the World) be without all reſpect of reverence, and that by Inſtitution of Authority, in ſo high a part of Gods Service, may not ſuch Kneeling be judged, if not a groſs mocking of Chriſt, as was the Souldiers their bowing of knees before him,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.29. Mal. 1.6, 7.</note> yet a taking the name of God in vain. Seeing all ſignifications of honour, in Gods Service, ought to be to the honour of his Name,<note place="margin">Jer. 4.2.</note> and an Oath not religiouſly intended (as in the nature thereof it ought to be) to the Honour of God, is the taking of Gods Name in vain.<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.18.</note> Did <hi>Naaman</hi> newly brought to the knowledge of God, attribute ſo much to bowing in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon</hi> when his Maſter leaned on him, ſo that it was not his voluntary Act? And ſhall we, who have had the <hi>Goſpel</hi> long, kneeling by Inſtitution and determination, in a principal part of Gods Service, make no account whether we Honour <hi>GOD,</hi> or no, by ſuch kneeling?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If <hi>Kneeling</hi> be inſtituted for a more reverent receiving, then it muſt be either in regard of God, or of Bread and Wine; If in regard of <hi>God</hi> then muſt we be well perſwaded that ſuch kneeling is an acceptable ſervice unto his Majeſty.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1. &amp; 14, 15, 23. Iſa 29.13. Matth. 15.9.</note> And that this may be, we muſt conſider, whether ſuch kneeling be a Will-worſhip or a ſervice reaſonable, and according to Gods Will. Leaſt otherwiſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119992:55"/> we finde our ſelves ſo far from honouring God, as that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him. As did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who offered incenſe,<note place="margin">Levit. 10.1, 2, 3.</note> but not with the very fire which God appointed, and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore devoured with fire. And as did King <hi>David,</hi> and the Prieſts,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 13.10. &amp; 15.12, 13.</note> who carried the Arke otherwiſe than it ought to have been, and therefore <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> died for it, with a ſodain death. For God will be ſanctified (if not <hi>by, yet</hi>) in all them that come neer him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But kneeling is contrary to the example of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, who miniſtred and received ſitting,<note place="margin">Luke 22.14.</note> or in ſuch a geſture as in thoſe Countreys was moſt uſed at eating. From which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to differ, without warrrant from Gods word cannot be without fault. Seeing examples of holy men, much more of Chriſt, are to be followed, except there be ſome reaſonable cauſe to the contrary.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1.</note> And the Apoſtle to reform an abuſe which crept (even in their times) into Love-feaſts, which were immediately before, or after the Lords Supper, did baniſh them thence, and reduced the manner of adminiſtring the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the firſt inſtitution, ſaying; <hi>Shall I praiſe you in this?</hi>

For if the Apoſtle would not tolerate an indifferent thing (as was a Love-feaſt till then) to continue ſo near the Lords Supper, when it was abuſed, how would they allow the change of ſitting into kneeling, eſpecially in theſe two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the abuſe of love feaſts, <hi>(viz. ſuperfluity)</hi> was never ſo great, and ſcandalous, in the Apoſtles time, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of <hi>kneeling</hi> (viz. <hi>Idolatry</hi>) was and is in the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome:</hi> And beſides, Love-feaſts were either before, or after the Lords Supper, whereas kneeling is in the principal part of the holy Communion. Therefore if the Apoſtle baniſhed Love-feaſts from the Lords Supper, becauſe of the abuſe, and brought the Church to the ſimplicity of the firſt Inſtitution, is it not a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin to retain the idolatrous kneeling of Papiſts, and reject the exemplary ſitting of our M.

And the rather, becauſe it is in that Sacrament, and in that part of the Sacrament, which eſpecially ſetteth forth our communion with Chriſt, and his Church, and is therefore, called <hi>The Communion.</hi>

We read not of any geſture of body preſcribed, or obſerved in Circumciſion and Baptiſme as in the Paſſeover and Lords Supper. Becauſe there needs no material regard to be had of any certain geſture in the two former Sacraments, ſo the foreskin were cut off, and water be uſed: But in the other two, a geſture, anſwerable to the action is requiſite.<note place="margin">Exod 12.11.</note> And therefore God preſcribed to his

Here a caveat is to be given, that none take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by this diſcourſe, to juſtifie the childiſh Pedagogy of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ceremonies deviſed by man, ſeeing ſitting was uſed by Chriſt, and the ſignification thereof is found in Scripture.

                  <p n="7">7. That kneeling may be more ſoundly convinced as a will-worſhip, objections are to be anſwered. Therefore where it is ſuppoſed that Chriſt and his Apoſtles miniſtred and received fitting but by occaſion, and not of purpoſe: becauſe they were ſitting before in eating the Paſſeover. Whereas if Chriſt had ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down of purpoſe to adminiſter the Communion, then all that is ſaid is granted to be ſome purpoſe. The anſwer is ſhort, yet full: Chriſt did ſit of purpoſe, when he miniſtred his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For after the Paſſeover he roſe, waſhed his Diſciples feet, and ſate down again.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If it be demanded, why the Church is not bound to the time of evening, as well as to the geſture of ſitting, ſith Chriſt obſerved the one, as well as the other? It may be anſwered;<note place="margin">John 13.4.12.</note> Time being a common circumſtance to every action (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done, but in ſome time) the particular time is not to be obſerved, except Chriſt had ſanctified it to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as God ſanctified the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> day, on which he reſted,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.2, 3.</note> or (at leaſt) choſen it of purpoſe, as he did <hi>ſitting.</hi> But whereas it was

Supper could be inſtituted in ſtead thereof: and preſently after Supper the hour came, when Chriſt was to be betrayed. Therefore if the <hi>Jews</hi> tranſgreſſed not the Inſtitution of the Paſſeover, by changing a geſture, at the firſt preſcribed by God according to that their preſent occaſion, into another fitter for a time of reſt, much leſs do Chriſtians tranſgreſs the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper, by changing the time taken by Chriſt upon occaſion, but not preſcribed, into ſome other fitter (in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) for the ordinary celebration of the Lords Supper, as probably the Primitive Churches did.

                  <p>It is further objected; That we may kneel in regard of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be uſed by preſcription of authority, at the delivering of the bread and wine, <hi>viz.

Now, what neceſſity is there of thoſe prayers, at that very time? ſeeing prayers go before, and follow after. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, muſt we needs kneel at every bit of a prayer? Is there more neceſſity to obey a needleſs direction to kneel at thoſe prayers, than to follow the example <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For he

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.5.23:</note> If then this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prayer to the ſacramentall forme of words, be not of faith, how then can we, with faith and a good conſcience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, or allow the ſame with our kneeling?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, for juſtifying of <hi>Kneeling,</hi> it is affirmed; That it is indifferent whether we ſit, ſtand, or kneel: ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſit, when he did eat the Paſſeover. Whereas God commanded the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> to eate the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> ſtanding, and ſome Reformed Churches receive ſtanding, for all that Chriſt did ſit at his laſt Supper: Therefore the KING may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Kneeling,</hi> as the moſt reverent geſture, and beſt beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo holy an action. For anſwer whereunto, howſoever that which is already ſaid may ſuffice. Yet it may be further conſidered, that though it be admitted, that it is indifferent to ſit, or to ſtand, yet it doth not follow, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For <hi>ſitting</hi> is the example, and <hi>ſtanding</hi> is a geſture ſometimes uſed in ordinary eating, and (in the objection) it is ſaid to be preſcribed at a Sacramentall feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Again, it doth not follow; That becauſe Chriſt uſed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture fitter for eating in his time, inſtead of a geſture preſcribed upon occaſion, it is therefore lawfull to uſe a geſture nothing anſwerable to eating,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.36.</note> and that taken out of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (as though the Word of God came out of it, or to it onely) inſtead of a geſture moſt anſwerable to eating, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119992:58"/> of purpoſe uſed by Chriſt at the Inſtitution of the Sacrament. So that, notwithſtanding all that is ſaid for Kneeling, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie (upon whom the burthen as of this geſture, ſo of other Ceremonies,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29.25.</note> is layd) may remember, That <hi>Hezekiah</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Levites</hi> in the houſe of the Lord, with Cimbals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandement of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> the Kings Seer, and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, for the commandement was by the hand of the Lord, and by the hand of his Prophets. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſider, that if <hi>Kneeling</hi> were the moſt reverent geſture, and beſt beſeeming the holy Communion, our Lord and Maſter would not have ſitten down of purpoſe, at his laſt ſupper. And that <hi>Ahaz</hi> was deceived in deeming the Altar at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> more honourable for Gods ſervice,<note place="margin">2 King. 16.10, 12.14.15.</note> than the Altar of the Lord.</p>

For no ſound Proteſtant of any knowledge, will affirme it, but rather preſently conſider, That if kneeling be inſtituted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in regard of bread and wine, it muſt be either becauſe they repreſent the body and blood of Chriſt, though remaining bread and wine touching their ſubſtance; And then for like reaſon, we may worſhip the Crucifix, and image of God, as the Papiſts do: Or, becauſe Chriſt is really, bodily, and locally, though inviſibly, preſent in them, either by <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> according to the hereſie of the Papiſts, or by <hi>Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> according to the hereſie of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> Theſe things cannot but be conſidered: And then it muſt needs follow, that if we abjure theſe hereſies of Papiſts, and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> we muſt alſo abhor idolatrous, and ſuperſtitious kneeling, their <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Nurſe,</hi> which was never heard of before <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> was hatched in the ſynagogue of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> bloud, notwithſtanding the Kings commandment. Here his Majeſtie known to be of a gentle diſpoſition, and to have learned, yea profeſſed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is moſt humbly prayed, to take this word (King) as ſpoken in imitation, and underſtood of <hi>Cantor:</hi> who knowne to be of a violent diſpoſition, did carry matters in the Convocation, and publiſhed Canons not orderly, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, as ſome of his ſuffragane prelates report, But it is impoſſible, that the Kings commandement ſhould make all ſo ſure that none can be ſcandalized, the general ignorance of the people, the diſpoſition, of the ignorant unto ſuperſtition, the old leaven of popery not purged and the multiplying of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, all well conſidered. Nay rather, It is likely, that by the commandementt the ſcandal will be the greater.

Why ſhould kneeling be thus urged by authority, if the ſacramental ſignes of the body, and bloud of Chriſt, be no more to be reverenced, than water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in baptizing children? Seeing that is alſo a ſanctified ſigne of Chriſt his bloud, that waſheth away our ſins, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If <hi>kneeling</hi> in the very act of <hi>taking, eating, and drinking</hi> the ſacramental bread and wine, in the holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, be (1) an inſtitution of man. (2) If it be the taking of of Gods name in vain, when it is without all reſpect of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (3) If God be not honoured thereby, except it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will. (4) If it ſwarve from the example of Chriſt his ſitting, and therefore deſerveth no praiſe. (4) If it be a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſin to reject the exemplary ſitting of Chriſt, whereby we ſhew our ſelves to be in communion with Chriſt, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; and to retain kneeling, which for bread-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought to be baniſhed, and whereby we ſeem to be in communion with Antichriſt, and his ſynagogue. (6) If it obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that rejoycing familiaritie in and with Chriſt which the

(8) If the lawfulneſs of chuſing a fitter time than the evening cannot juſtifie our rejecting Chriſt his exemplary ſitting. (9) If the bits of prayer joyned with the words of inſtitution do make kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more ſinfull. (10) If kneeling be not as indifferent, as ſtanding, nor beſt beſeeming the holy communion, and the King muſt appoint nothing but by the hand of the Lord. (11) If we ought to abhor kneeling, as we abhor the worſhipping of Images, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>Conſubſtantiation.</hi> (12) If to ſcandalize be grievouſly to ſin, and kneeling be a ſhew of the greateſt evils, and withall the greateſt ſcandal. And (13) If it be a begging of the queſtion to affirm, kneeling to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the Kings commandement (ſo called) doth rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, than leſſen ſcandal by kneeling, It may be averred, that kneeling in the very act of Taking, eating, and drinking the ſacramental bread and wine, in the holy communion, cannot be without ſin.</p>

                     <hi>Of the Signe of the Croſs in Baptiſm.</hi> The uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſme is not a thing indifferent, but utterly unlawfull. For this reaſon.</head>
                  <p>IT is againſt the Apoſtles precept 1. <hi>John</hi> 5.21. <hi>Babes keep your ſelves from Idolls.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Profe of the Major.</note> For the explanation whereof two things are to be ſcanned, firſt: what is meant by an Idol. Secondly: how far we are to keep our ſelves from the Idol. An Idol is what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beſides God is worſhipped with divine honour. And though ſome reſtrain an Idol to a viſible form, becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived <hi>apo tou eidous</hi> yet as a learned writer obſerveth<note n="a" place="margin">Zanch de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demp, lib. 1. cap. 17. Theſ. 5.</note> They which will treat of all ſorts of Idolatrie, muſt needs take the name of an Idol in a larger ſignification. By the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an Idoll is underſtood whatſoever beſides the true God a man doth propoſe or frame to himſelfe to be worſhipped, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimplie, or in ſome reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this ſpoken without good reaſon, for nothing is properly an Idol, as it is a viſible form, but as it is religiouſly worſhipped. If therefore it be worſhipped it may be an Idoll, though it be no viſible ſhape, otherwiſe the worſhipping of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the ſouls of juſt men were no Idolatrie, ſeeing theſe are inviſible ſpirits, and therefore the ſigne of the Croſs If it be religouſly worſhipped, may prove an Idol though it be <hi>tranſiens quiddam</hi> a thing vaniſhing in the Ayre and no perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent form. For as that learned Zanchy ſpeaketh there is a two fold Idol, the one real the other imaginary, conceived only in the mind.<note place="margin">How far we to keep our are ſelves from an Idol.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer to the ſecond queſtion. Men may keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Idols two wayes: vix. <hi>a cultu, &amp; ab uſu Idoli:</hi> from the worſhip, and from the uſe of the Idol.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.15 10.13.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo ſtrict that he alloweth not the Chriſtians ſo much as to be preſent in the Temple at the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous feaſts, though they did it without any internal opinion, or external action of worſhipping the Idol.</p>
                  <p>But John in this place doth not ſpeak ſo much of the worſhip as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119992:61"/> the uſe of the Idoll for (as Aug. in pſa. 113. well obſerveth) the Apoſtle commandeth that they avoid not only the the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Images, but alſo the Images or Idols themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now the uſe of an Image, or Idol, may be civil or religious, and both of them publick or private.</p>
                  <p>That an Image, even ſuch an Image as is Idolatrouſly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, may be made and retayned for civill reſpects of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtory or ſuch like: we make no queſtion, though the tolerating of them in open and publick places, even <hi>extra cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> be offenſive and turn into a ſnare, as Gideons Ephod was to his poſteritie, when it was abuſed to Idolatrie. And upon this ground we yeild, that though the Croſs be apparently an Idoll, yet in Princes Banners, Coronations, Coyn, Crown, or any other Civil reſpect it may have a lawfull uſe: But that any thing of mans deviſing being worſhipped as an Idol, ſhould be uſed <hi>religionis,</hi> ergo: and in the worſhip of God, ſeemeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt S. <hi>Johns</hi> precept, for, how do I keep my ſelf from the Idoll, or how do I ſhew my zealous deteſtation of that filthy Idolatry, when I retayn it, and uſe it ſo honourably, as in the Temple, in the Sanctuary; in the ſervice of God. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this place of S. <hi>John,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Homil againſt peril of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try part 2. Exod. 23. &amp; 34 13, Deut. 7, 5, Pſa. 16.4.</note> doth on the warrant of <hi>Tertullian</hi> approve and commend.</p>
                  <p>And this poynt is further ſtrengthened by the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: which forbiddeth not only to worſhip, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to make an Image, or any ſimilitude whatſoever, to wit, <hi>ad cultum,</hi> or for religious uſe: as according to the Scripture the beſt interpretors,<note n="d" place="margin">Calvin. inſti. lib. 1 cap. 11, Urſin cathe. in expoſit ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> precept.

And what ſtronger provocation to that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual whordome, then erecting Images in the place of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip? For as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well obſerveth, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. Idols or Images, have greater power to corrupt a ſilly ſoul, in that they have a mouth, eyes, ears noſe, hands, feet, then to correct it, in that they neither heare, ſmell, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And therefore without doubt, the meaning of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is to binde the Church from all ſuch ſnares and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſin, and therfore doth <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſup. Levit. q.</hi> 68. well conclude from this commandement, that ſuch making of an Idol can never be juſt or lawfull.</p>
                  <p>Now if no ſimilitude at all be tollerable in Gods ſervice; then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119992:62"/> much leſs any that hath been and is worſhipped Idolatrouſly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> accounted them Idolaters, not only which worſhipped, but thoſe alſo which made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Images (<hi>nempe ad cultum</hi> or for holy uſe) &amp; in his Book <hi>de Idololatria,</hi> he vehemently reproved the very makers of Images, though they did not themſelves worſhip them, which ſheweth in what execration the primitive Churches held any religious uſe of an Idol.</p>
                  <p>The like we may find in <hi>Epiphanius ad Johannem Epu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſal.</hi> where he reporteth, that finding an Image of Chriſt, or ſome Saint, hanging at a Church dore, he rent it in peices, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching that to hang a picture in the Church of Chriſt, was contrary to the authority of the Scriptures and the Chriſtian religion.</p>
                  <p>From hence I conclude, that if the godly fathers were ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, againſt erecting Images of Chriſt, and of the Saints, even at that time before any worſhip was given unto them; Much more would they withſtand it now, after men have made Idols of them. And if they would not ſuffer an Idol ſo much as in the place of Gods worſhip: would they endure themſelves to uſe ſuch an Idol as the Croſs in the ſervice and ſacraments of God. Their zeal againſt that ſpiritual fornication, would never permit them ſo h ghly to honour ſuch an execrable thing neither was their zeal herein without ground of knowledge: for the ſpirit of God in pſal. 115.8 ſpeaking of Idolls, they (ſaith he) that make them are like unto them, and ſo are all they that truſt in them Where a plain difference is made between makers and worſhippers of Idols and both condemned, as curſed tranſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greſſors of the law, ſhall any then make the Idoll of the Croſſe, and that <hi>for religious uſe:</hi> and yet be innocent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hſa. 16.14.</note>Queſtionleſs by Davids example we muſt make no mention, that is to keep no honorable memory of an Idol, and therefore without doubt,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50.22.</note> not give it ſo much honor as to uſe it, or the memorial thereof in the houſe of God and in his holy worſhip, but as <hi>Iſai</hi> ſaith, we muſt pollute the reliques and the very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and ornament of the Idol, and caſt them away as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous cloth, and ſay unto it, get thee hence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Profe of the Minor.</note>Now if any doubt, whether the ſigne of the Croſſe be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſo made an Idol: let them well conſider the tract of <hi>Bellarmine, de adoratione crucis,</hi> where diſtinguiſhing the <hi>Croſs</hi> on which Chriſt was hanged, from the ſimilitude thereof, he ſaith: other croſſes like to this are accounted ſacred images.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119992:62"/> And after he diſtinguiſheth thoſe ſimilitudes of Chriſts <hi>Croſs,</hi> into the Image, and ſigne of the Croſs; ſo that if the Image of the Croſſe be taken for an Idoll (and who knoweth not that it is the univerſal Idoll of popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be adored, even <hi>cultu latriae</hi> (which worſhip as they themſelves hold, is due only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God): the ſigne of the Croſs muſt needs be taken for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Image and ſigne of the Croſs is of one, and the ſame account with Papiſts, appeareth evidently as by divers, ſo particularly by Hart.

Right ſo the Papiſts aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the ſigne of the Croſſe, that honor and confidence which belongeth to God, do make it an execrable Idol, and ſo moſt unfit to ſtand in the ſanctuary, or to be annexed to the holy things of God.<note place="margin">Queſt. diſputat. devenal pecto de effect.

                  <p>All which doth moſt manifeſtly prove, that among the Papiſts, it is religiouſly honoured both with inward confidence, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence.

Neither is it a ſufficient anſwer to ſay, that the croſs amongſt us is neither in number nor in uſe, the ſame that theirs is, and though their croſs be an Idoll, yet ours is not. For when God commanded his people to break down the Images of the Heathen, and to extinguiſh the very name of them; had they performed that charge, if they had burnt all the Idolls of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and afterward made new of the ſame form, and to another uſe though not Idolatrous, yet reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious? Or how have we diſcharged our duties and ſhewed our deteſtation of that filthy Idolatry, if having defaced all the popiſh Crucifixes and Idolls, we erect them new in our Church though not to Worſhip them, yet to any other holy uſe whatſoever. It is true that our croſs, and theirs is the ſame both in name, &amp; form, but not in uſe, for then it were Idolatrous; now I do not ſay that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth commit Idolatry, but that it ought to abſtain not onely from Idolatry or Worſhip, but even from all religious uſe of ſuch humane Ordinances and inventions, which others have and do Idolatrouſly adore. For if to erect Crucifixes, and other Popiſh Images for holy uſe be (contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement) a keeping of an honourable memory of the Idoll,<note place="margin">Exod. 23 13. Deut. 12.2.

                     <p>Now it is further to be noted that a double uſe of the croſs is mentioned in antiquity, the one Civil, the other Religious, againſt the former we do not diſpute, yeilding all reverence to thoſe Chriſtians, which by that note ſhewed their rejoycing and glory, in that which the Heathens counted their ſhame, but now, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe hath turned both the Image and the ſign of the croſs into an Idoll, it ſeemeth thereby to be made execrable. For <hi>Gideons</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod being firſt a Civil monument of victory, when the people went a whoring after it, was it lawful for the Magiſtrate to erect in the Tabernacle or Synagogue though not the ſame, yet the like, both in name and form to any religious uſe? would it have ſufficed to ſay this is not the ſame Ephod that <hi>Iſrael</hi> maketh an Idoll of, neither is it ſet here to be worſhipped (for your brethren do grievouſly ſin therein) but onely to keep in mind the great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory that God by <hi>Gideon</hi> gave to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Right ſo the croſs uſed by the Ancients, to ſhew that they were not aſhamed of Chriſt crucified being meerely civil, and yet expreſſing a moſt Chriſtian reſolution, having been abuſed, yea, continuing to be worſhipped both in Image and in ſign, it ſeemeth that this filth hath made it unfit, on any pretence of reſtoring it to his ancient uſe, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the holy things of the Sanctuary: eſpecially while there are ſo many Papiſts that ſuperſtitiouſly abuſe it among us. Now for the religious uſe of the croſs by the Ancients, it was never free from ſin and ſuperſtition as afterwards is ſhewed, and if it were, yet being an humane Ordinance, and now not onely abuſed to Idolatry, but becoming it ſelf a moſt abominable Idoll, no water can cleanſe it, nor any pretext purifie it for the holy ſervice of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> But in very deed, to ſpeak as the truth is, the croſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among us with opinion very ſuperſtitious and erronious, for in the late Canons<note place="margin">Canon 30.</note> it is ſaid, that the child <hi>(c)</hi> is thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto the ſervice of him that died on the croſs.

                     <p>It were ſuperfluous to rehearſe the reſt.

                     <p>Secondly, though at this time popery was not hatched, yet the myſtery of iniquity was then a working, and the beginning as it were of the whoriſh fornications was found even in the Fathers times, ſo that, as worſhipping of Angels in <hi>Paules</hi> time,<note place="margin">Coloſi. 2.18.</note> prayers and oblations for the dead in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, be rightly counted Popiſh and Antichriſtian, though as yet that monſter was not born: So this and other ceremonies ratified by the popiſh canons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, may well be taken for Popiſh and Antichriſtian, even in the Fathers times, ſeeing they then made away for the beaſt, and ſince have received fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impiety and authority from him:<note place="margin">Eſay. 52.11.</note> wherefore to conclude as <hi>Iſay</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods people, to keep themſelves from the rites and pollutions of the heathen, ſaying, depart, depart ye, go out from them and touch no unclean thing: So the ſpirit in the ſame manner chargeth the Church not to meddle with the corruptions of Antichriſtian <hi>Babylon,</hi> but go out of her my people ſaith he, that ye may not be partaker of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.<note place="margin">Apoca. 18.4.</note>
